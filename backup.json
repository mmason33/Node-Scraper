This principle highlights insights and practical recommendations that will challenge your thinking around <em>brand</em>.<br><strong>Vision is a picture of the future, so ensure it&apos;s crystal clear</strong> <br>If your company&#x2019;s vision isn&#x2019;t clear, and your team isn&#x2019;t talking about the impact it&#x2019;s trying to make in the world, then it&#x2019;s time to revisit the vision. It should be a clear and inspiring statement that paints a picture of how your brand wants to see the world changed based on its role. The vision should be big and bold. It should stretch and inspire your people as well as those who hear it.<strong>Are you on a mission, if so which one?</strong> <br>A mission is how your brand intends to make the vision a reality. A mission statement is not theoretical, but rather makes a factual declaration of your brand&#x2019;s intent. Think about a mission statement much like a clearly articulated military mission. It&#x2019;s definitive and directional&#x2014;it maps and identifies what your brand plans to do, and how it will realize its vision.<strong>Ensure your values are valued</strong> <br>Values are the beliefs and principles that guide your brand&#x2019;s actions. It&#x2019;s imperative your people understand and embrace them. Values are fundamental beliefs (people-centered principles) that guide decision-making, debates, and the actions that help to shape and define the character and integrity of the company.<strong>A well-crafted strategy is like the unfolding plot in a great story</strong> <br>Strategy connects the characters, helps define their actions, and compels the audience to pay attention and stay engaged. A compelling and clear strategy deliberately directs and guides the actions of employees and partners ensuring they each have clear focus and are directionally connected to the overall goals of the company.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"What would change if we spent as much time glorifying start lines as we do finish lines? What if we cheered as wildly for people the moment they assume their position at the starting block as we do when they run through the tape at the end of the race?<br> <br> As a person who has crossed numerous finish lines, my ego and I have a vested interest in glorification. A lot of doors have opened for me because of my ability to break through tape, but I&#x2019;ll tell you from experience that finish lines are the least interesting part. What excites me the most are starting lines. And to be frank, I believe it&#x2019;s our ability to step up to the starting line that truly prompts all the doors to swing open.<br> <br> <a href=\"http://www.jcf-myth.org/about-joseph-campbell/\">Joseph Campbell</a> named this kind of starting line the &#x201C;Call to Adventure&#x201D;. He defined the Call as a blunder, a stumbled upon chance that reveals unsuspected worlds, an epiphany that something else is out there. These are moments when we become capable of shifting from ordinary to extraordinary and from human to hero. But, how do we hear our own Call to Adventure? How do we know when a starting line is really a Call?<br> <br> We can start by looking at some famous fictional Calls. For example, Luke Skywalker was a bored and lonely farm boy living on a distant planet when he received a life-changing holographic message from a droid. Harry Potter was locked in a cupboard under the stairs until letters revealing his true identity began arriving, delivered by a series of owls. Dorothy Gale and her ratty looking terrier were chillin&#x2019; in Kansas until a tornado shook things up.<br> <br> These iconic characters, and many others like them, have one thing in common: prior to their Calls they were generally discontent with life. They weren&#x2019;t living in terror. Life wasn&#x2019;t miserable, but boredom and frustration were creeping in.<em>That&#x2019;s sign number one: if your regular life doesn&#x2019;t feel like it fits anymore, if dissatisfaction is seeping in through the cracks of the walls you&#x2019;ve carefully built around you, PAY ATTENTION. This is the universe&#x2019;s way of preparing you.</em>Next comes the actual Call. It can come in many forms. You might hear or see something. You might meet a new person or get an interesting email. Mine came in the form of a small blue sign that was dangling from the top of a ski lift, but that&#x2019;s a <a href=\"http://www.stephjagger.com/#about-rally-cry\">whole other story</a>. The point here is this: there are an infinite number of ways a Call can show up. And regardless of the variety, there&#x2019;s a singular feature you can always count on &#x2013; <strong>absolutely, unequivocally, your Call will be absurd.</strong> I&#x2019;m not joking. It will be totally absurd. But please, don&#x2019;t confuse absurd with asinine, the Call won&#x2019;t be stupid. It won&#x2019;t be lacking in any and all intelligence, but it will be unreasonable and highly unlikely.<br> <br> Listen, the universe doesn&#x2019;t do mundane or logical. That&#x2019;s a human thing. No, no.&#xA0;The universe does wildly unreasonable. It does miraculous. It does things that border on ridiculous, things your human brain or the brains of the people around you might immediately classify as impossible. <strong>Your Call will be inspirational as opposed to rational.</strong><br> <br> There are two reasons for this: first, if your Call was reasonable, it wouldn&#x2019;t classify as an adventure; second, if your Call was easy, there wouldn&#x2019;t be growth involved. And you know that&#x2019;s what this is all about, right? Emotional growth, spiritual growth, professional growth, growth of any kind.&#xA0;<br> <br> So just to be clear, these are the ingredients required for a starting line:If we are going to actually step up to our starting line, we must have the courage to take action. The problem is, even once we see our starting lines, they are easy to ignore. Because things aren&#x2019;t horrible and because the idea itself is questionable.<br> <br> Instead we make small changes. We convince ourselves that we&#x2019;re able to grow by taking small risks instead of saying yes to the big ones. We change the color of our hair or buy a snazzy new road bike. We trade in Flaming Hot Cheetos and House of Cards for kale chips and PX90. Some of us might even change jobs or careers &#x2013; but even those changes are just band-aids when we know we&#x2019;ve been called, when we know there&#x2019;s a starting line right in front of us but we&#x2019;re scared to put our toe on it.<br> <br> I&#x2019;m not saying it&#x2019;s easy. Getting to the starting line, saying yes to a call to adventure, well&#x2026; it&#x2019;s one of the hardest things a person can do. I&#x2019;ve done it multiple times, and it&#x2019;s gotten harder each time. But it&#x2019;s worth it because nothing feels better than knowing I&#x2019;ve been asked to go after something bigger and that I said yes to something more important than the finish line that&#x2019;s being used as the bait.<br> <br> Let me leave you with this: Are you ignoring a Call to Adventure in your life? Ask yourself, what would change if you shifted your focus? What would change if you stopped looking for finish lines and put your feet in the blocks instead?<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Not sure about you, but I couldn&#x2019;t live in a world without hope. A life without optimism, imagination and hope would be like a life without a smart phone. Think about it. We live in a world where individuals and governments are constantly providing the media with opportunities to create a mood of negativity, fear and anxiety, but the one driving force that gives us renewed energy is <em>hope</em>. Hope that situations will improve, that there is a better way. Hope can move us from a negative state of mind to a positive one. It is a gift for moods and a force for change.I recently heard Dr. Beach deliver a commencement speech at SDSU&#x2019;s graduation centered around the power of hope. Don&#x2019;t leave home without it&#x2026;<strong>The value of hope</strong><br> Dr. Beach understands the value and meaning of hope at a deep and transformational level because he&#x2019;s been researching it in all of its manifestations for the past 10 years. But, his journey researching and writing about hope by started by happenstance.As part of a wider research project, he and his team were studying the reactions of family members during phone calls where they were receiving news from doctors about cancer. Dr. Beach and his team noticed a pattern where bad news always gave rise to good news&#x2014;to something positive and uplifting&#x2014;and that the possibility of healing and staying together as a family when facing an uncertain and fearful future gave way to hope. When he extended his research into video-recorded communication between cancer patients and doctors at the Moores UCSD Cancer Center, they observed the same pattern. In the very midst of addressing malignant tumors and metastasis, talk shifted to hopeful possibilities and good news, pointing to the power and presence of hope.<strong>The presence of hope</strong><br> We can find the presence and guiding light of hope in everyday situations and in the advice and wisdom of many of the world&#x2019;s finest leaders. San Diego&#x2019;s Jonas Salk once stated, &#x201C;Hope lies in dreams, in imagination, and in the courage of those who dare to make dreams into reality&#x201D;. Martin Luther King Jr. reminded us, &#x201C;Disappointment is finite, but hope is infinite&#x201D;, and Bill Cosby once said, &#x201C;There is hope for the future because God has a sense of humor&#x2014;and we are funny to God&#x201D;. John Lennon sang: &#x201C;Imagine all the people living life in peace. You may say I&#x2019;m a dreamer, but I&#x2019;m not the only one. I hope someday you&#x2019;ll join us, and the world will be as one&#x201D;. And a Japanese mother, standing in the rubble, holding the newborn son she gave birth to at the same time the earthquake and tsunami occurred said, &#x201C;I want my son to be strong and to bring hope to the future of Japan&#x201D;.<strong>Hope = Optimism + Imagination + Determination</strong><br> Journeys through life are no doubt filled with troubles, dilemmas, and afflictions. Jobs, training, finances, diverse relationships&#x2014;these and more await you. Yet it is our greatest challenges that provide the most unique opportunities for growth.So how can you bring hope to the future and remain feverish with hope? How can you move forward with the realization that hope is not just something in one&#x2019;s head, or heart, but something done together as we work to accomplish goals, manage troubles and navigate through daily experiences?<strong>There is always hope</strong><br> Dr. Beach believes that hope is essential as people respond to their calling to be leaders and change-agents capable of improving the world in which we live. If you live with hope at the forefront of your days, you can be that person or company who reassures those in trouble or turmoil that their difficulties will pass, offer encouragement that a better way is not out of reach, and demonstrate to others that you are fully committed to their well being.Evidence for being hopeful is abundant and lives freely among us. If you learn from your mistakes, if you give as much, if not more, than you receive or if you show compassion to those in need, there is hope.Hope, in its most powerful form, provides a resource of strength and resolve, that good will eventually arise from bad, certainty from uncertainty, and hope from despair.<strong>UNCOMMON SENSE OBSERVATIONS</strong><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Hello, I&#x2019;m Krystle Wurster and I lead social media for Bulldog Drummond. We work with a diverse range of companies and people to break through the noise and meaningfully connect by looking, feeling and being completely different. A large part of this is through storytelling, and I&#x2019;m fortunate because a large part of what I do each day is working with seasoned executives, thought-leaders, authors and storytellers who help tell these stories.&#xA0; &#xA0;Each month our content team comes together to think about people and brands that best communicate our editorial themes. Our theme last month, <a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/principle/the-worlds-a-stage-whats-your-story#filters\"><em>The World&#x2019;s A Stage, What&#x2019;s Your Story?</em></a>&#xA0;sparked the inspiration to reach out to <a href=\"https://chatbooks.com/\">Chatbooks</a>. When Rachel Hofstetter, CMO of Chatbooks, found time to talk with me I didn&#x2019;t want to end the conversation. Her personality is addictive and so is their brand.I use Chatbooks almost every day to tell the story of the first year of my daughter&#x2019;s life and share it with our friends and family. Their user-interface and seamless digital integration simplifies photo-printing. Sure, there are a lot of photo printing sources out there, but for me, Chatbooks is the most seamless and easiest to use. And their customer service is phenomenal. I&#x2019;ve naturally become an advocate because they do such a tremendous job on so many levels of their business.&#xA0;<strong>Photo books for people who don&#x2019;t have time to make photo books. </strong>Chatbooks started three short years ago when Vanessa Quigley, Chatbooks founder and mom of 7, was looking at a photo book her son&#x2019;s preschool teacher had made. She loved it, and at that moment realized she had yet to print any photos of her son. As her family grew, their photo albums shrunk. As a scrapbook enthusiast this pained Vanessa, but also sparked an idea. She knew that printing photos should be easy and wanted to create a way to make that happen.Within a week of pitching the idea to her husband, they designed a prototype and it had instant success. It turned out solving her own problem also solved other parent&#x2019;s problems. Their video has 70 million+ views.<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PTTs7ewuDY8\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>The company model is successful because it solves many of the pain points that come with printing photo albums, like photo sizing, spacing and even act of printing. Through their automated model, their <a href=\"https://chatbooks.com/download-the-app/\">application</a> allows people to sync photos by adding them to their Favorites on their devices and with the touch of a button photos are saved, automatically uploaded to the app, placed properly into an album and once it reaches the 60 photo mark the book is printed and shipped. People can also link the app to their Instagram or Facebook accounts to sync photos. And there&#x2019;s always an option to customize and edit books if you want to take personal ownership of the final output. Chatbooks is extending their offerings by tapping into brand partnerships like their recent collaboration with<a href=\"https://chatbooks.com/riflepaperco/\"> Rifle Paper</a> to offer specialty albums.<strong>Helping people remember what matters.</strong>Chatbooks has also nailed the family-friendly price of $8 per book. It takes the pressure away from feeling like the album needs to be perfect. And the result is that they are more candid, authentic and personal. My daughter&#x2019;s first blood draw ended up in one of her albums, perhaps not the sweetest moment, but to me an important part of her first-year life story.Chatbooks helps people forget about the stresses of taking time to document memories and instead spend more time creating them. They believe in the connections they create and the stories they help to tell. They&#x2019;ve impressed me and I <a href=\"https://chatbooks.com/free-chatbooks-book/\" target=\"_blank\">encourage you to give them the opportunity to do the same for you</a>. &#xA0;&#xA0;<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"My niece is heading off to college this year. As tradition dictates, she&#x2019;s applied to a number of different universities. Her long-term boyfriend is enrolled at one of these universities, and there&#x2019;s no evidence it won&#x2019;t be where he completes his educational career. Upon hearing this I instantaneously blurted out, &#x201C;But imagine how cool it would be to go to a place where no one knows you and you can define and create your identity&#x2014;on your own&#x2014;as you wish.&#x201D; Luckily, she&#x2019;s a very smart girl and agreed with me. How much of this was because I was in the car next to her I&#x2019;ll never know, but what I do know is that in that moment, we both opened our minds to the idea of <em>identity</em>&#x2014;something I honestly hadn&#x2019;t put a whole lot of thought into before.If you ask Google to define identity, you&#x2019;ll get a multitude of answers ranging from <em>Psychology Today&#x2019;s</em> description of it as &#x201C;the answer to the question <em>who am I</em>&#x201D; to more esoteric Kierkegaardian philosophy focusing on the absurdity of the whole concept altogether. I&#x2019;m sure this basically means that we&#x2019;re all struggling with the entire concept of identity&#x2014;we always have and probably always will be. Perhaps that&#x2019;s just part of the human condition. But for the purposes of this article I&#x2019;m going to propose this simple three-part description:If you&#x2019;re at all like me, on a typical day you tend to think of your identity as rather static (or you don&#x2019;t think about it at all). You are who you are. You do what you do. You are either optimistic, pessimistic or somewhere in between. You might be an introvert or an extrovert. You either view strangers as potential friends or people to be avoided. We walk around with these handles, and assume that they are &#x201C;us&#x201D;&#x2014;unwavering and set in stone. I&#x2019;d argue that identity is actually opposite. In fact, I&#x2019;m starting to think that identity is one of the most fluid and malleable things out there.For one moment, go down to the microscopic level with me. Picture our bodies as atoms and molecules, and all those other things we learned about in science class. Now picture our identities the same way. How could we not be in a constant state of ebb and flow with the people and places around us? We&#x2019;re constantly letting go of stuff, absorbing new stuff, and remixing our total constitutions. This is potentially either a really frustrating situation or a really liberating one, and I&#x2019;m tending towards the latter. Here&#x2019;s why&#x2026;There are a few things that have a pretty significant influence on our identity that we simply can&#x2019;t change: where we grew up, who are parents are, the genetics we were given. And even with these things I&#x2019;d call the &#x201C;non-negotiables,&#x201D; we are in complete control of how they affect our identity&#x2014;we decide on the role they play. When it comes down to it, our identity is completely up to us. It&#x2019;s on our hands, and it&#x2019;s ours to do what we wish with<strong>Identity is really one of life&#x2019;s greatest games&#x2014;and like all great games&#x2014;it invites us to play.</strong>So then, why haven&#x2019;t we all signed up? We can mold our identities. We can shape them and refine them. We can experiment with new takes on them. We can shed parts that we don&#x2019;t like, and pick up new parts from people around us. We can choose the influences, people, experiences and places that play a part. As Chuck Palahniuk, author of <em>Invisible Monsters</em> said, &#x201C;Nothing of me is original. I am the combined efforts of everybody I&#x2019;ve ever known.&#x201D; But as any home baker knows, combining well&#x2026; takes the right tools, knowledge, practice and time.Imagine looking at every day as a chance to prototype something new with your identity&#x2014;from the order you make at the coffee shop, to the conversation you have with the receptionist at the end of the day. What do you say? How do you act? What do you &#x201C;try on for size?&#x201D; Maybe you weren&#x2019;t into glam rock, but you go to KISS concert and decide it&#x2019;s the best thing you&#x2019;ve ever seen and heard. Do you incorporate it into your identity or reject it as a one-off? (I mean really&#x2014;you&#x2019;re far too old to take on new habits and new fancies!) Maybe a friend tells you that you&#x2019;re the most adventurous person they&#x2019;ve ever met. Do you go back home to ponder why they&#x2019;re so off base with a cup of green tea, or do you buy a ticket to Greenland? The possibilities are literally endless.This same sense of play applies to couples, friends, families and companies. We all share in collective identities&#x2014;and like our own personal ones&#x2014;these collective ones can be explored, shaped and reinvented.Most of the work that I do professionally involves helping brands find their identity. The best brands, and therefore the most fun and rewarding clients, are the ones that are willing to admit when it&#x2019;s time to change, understand what to let go of, and have the willingness to go on the journey to find something new. I&#x2019;d argue that the best &#x201C;identities,&#x201D; and therefore the most fun and rewarding people, are the ones who do the same. They know when it&#x2019;s time to change. They&#x2019;re willing to let go. And they&#x2019;re fired up on the search for something new.Let&#x2019;s not be static this year. Let&#x2019;s not assume that what&#x2019;s been set in stone actually is, and let&#x2019;s start to play with how we see ourselves, how the world sees us, and how we relate to the world around us.LeBron James once said, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know how tall I am, or how much I weigh, because I don&#x2019;t want anybody to know my identity. I&#x2019;m like a superhero. Call me Basketball Man.&#x201D; I&#x2019;m honestly not sure exactly what he meant, but I&#x2019;m pretty sure it means he&#x2019;s playing with the idea of his identity. He claimed &#x201C;Basketball Man.&#x201D; He put it out there as an audacious thing to live up to&#x2014;and he became it.We may not all be skilled enough to claim LeBron&#x2019;s rights on the court, but we can all create and re-create ourselves just like the man who literally adorns half the Heat&#x2019;s stadium walls. And to round it all out, I think my niece is exactly like LeBron James. She&#x2019;s entering a game that&#x2019;s worth playing, and she&#x2019;s taking center court. Play on Wayne. Play on Garth.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"It&#x2019;s easy to get caught-up in our day-to-day lives entrenched in routine and forgetting to challenge or inspire ourselves. Sometimes all it takes is a well delivered commencement address to remind us to wake up and, for a moment, observe life through the lens of a young emerging adult.To kick start your inspiration we are sharing a series of our favorite commencement speeches to help you to appreciate life in uncommon ways.The first speech we&#x2019;re sharing is titled <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CrOL-ydFMI\" target=\"_blank\"><em>This is Water</em></a> and was delivered by <a href=\"http://www.davidfosterwallacebooks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">David Foster Wallace</a>. It&#x2019;s packed with uncommon sense insight and wisdom, as Wallace offers us a healthy dose of brutal honesty.<strong>Life is far from perfect</strong>As we know, adult American life often involves &#x201C;boredom, routine and petty frustration.&#x201D; Since we can&#x2019;t make those pieces of life disappear, our mission and our challenge becomes choosing &quot;what we pay attention to and how we construct meaning from experience.&quot;We don&#x2019;t tend to think that sitting in rush hour traffic or going to the grocery store on the way home from a long day at work are the important parts of our days, of our lives. The important moments are usually the happy or triumphant ones, the big promotions or amazing vacations or momentous celebrations. But to Wallace, those are the easy moments. It&#x2019;s not hard to have a good attitude when something great happens.<strong>Let&#x2019;s focus on the imperfection </strong>Turns out, the &#x201C;petty, frustrating crap&#x201D; is worth focusing on because it is in these moments that we have to work hard to choose a new perspective. The mundane, frustrating, exhausting parts of our days matter because these are the moments that we are able to choose to see differently.<strong>By default, you are the center of your world</strong>Choosing to see things from a new perspective is hard because we are each, by default, at the center of our own world. We are all &#x201C;operating on the automatic, unconscious belief that I am the center of the world, and that my immediate needs and feelings are what should determine the world&apos;s priorities.&#x201D; But life doesn&#x2019;t work that way.So the challenge is to choose to shake up our default setting and decide to be conscious instead of self-centered. To choose empathy rather than judgment and anger; to choose to see the world through the eyes of those around us and find ourselves humbled at the human experience rather than frustrated by the mundaneness of our immediate personal lives.&#xA0;Because if you are able to get outside of your own viewpoint, &#x201C;it will actually be within your power to experience a crowded, hot, slow, consumer-hell type situation as not only meaningful, but sacred, on fire with the same force that lit the stars: love, fellowship, the mystical oneness of all things deep down. Not that that mystical stuff is necessarily true. The only thing that&apos;s capital-T True is that you get to decide how you&apos;re gonna try to see it.&#x201D; Though it may feel ridiculous to see a bumper to bumper traffic jam or a check-out line stretching all the way down the cereal aisle as sacred, it is possible. No one but you can control your internal response to an external situation, and that is a profound freedom that can never be taken from you. It just so happens that &#x201C;the important kind of freedom is not glamorous.&#x201D;<strong>Appreciating every step means <em>every</em> step, not just the easy ones</strong>We all know how hard appreciating every step actually is. There will be days where we don&#x2019;t have the energy to switch off of default mode. But finding joy and meaning in life does not come from existing in a picture perfect world where we never encounter boredom or frustration. It comes from choosing how we see our lives and our experiences. As humans, we have the ability to view something beautiful in a negative light and take away its goodness. We also have the choice to reframe something that originally seemed like complete and utter garbage. Maybe sometimes, the garbage is just garbage. But there is almost always some good we can take away. So find your traffic jam and enjoy every moment of it.&#xA0;<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PhhC_N6Bm_s\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"One problem that almost every person in a leadership position can relate to is the ability to scale time to meet the needs of all their people. We know the importance of interaction, sharing lessons learned and celebrating successes and failures. But carving the time to do so in-between board-meetings, financial reviews, travel and daily to-dos doesn&#x2019;t often leave much time to dedicate to mentoring our people.&#xA0;We recently had the opportunity to sit with Josh Hotsenpiller, founder of <a href=\"https://wisdomcapture.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wisdom Capture,</a> to learn about his business and how he plans to use the service to expand access to leadership for brands.<strong>Scale internal voices to make change</strong>Wisdom Capture captures your wisdom for you. Recognizing the impossibility of hundreds of people personally connecting with each senior executive, Wisdom Capture helps accessibility by scaling the mentorship exchange and turning it digital. They call these &#x201C;wisdom exchanges&#x201D; which are delivered in a series of 1-3 minute videos that focus on a singular competency.The idea came from a simple meeting between Hotsenpiller and Jeff Campbell, former CEO of Burger King, after asking his mentor to tell him everything he had learned about bringing a product to market. Hotsenpiller left the conversation so inspired that he wanted to share the message with everyone.Post that meeting, Hotsenpiller had difficulties himself scaling to meet the needs of his position in leadership, and the idea of Wisdom Capture was born. The company is quickly growing with six digital products in their pipeline ready to launch and 300 Wisdom Captures filmed to-date featuring astronauts and ambassadors to executives and successful entrepreneurs all sharing their life lessons.<strong>A transparent process yields authentic results</strong>What makes Wisdom Capture unique is their approach, and that approach yields results. They create authentic learning lessons by taking preparation out of the equation so people aren&#x2019;t hearing cookie cutter responses&#x2014;nor do they edit. All of their videos are filmed intentionally to be conversational, raw and genuine. They use the idea of &#x201C;memory recall&#x201D; to trigger memories from their interviewees and probe for more authentic responses which results in stories people can relate to.<em>&#x201C;We don&apos;t believe wisdom belongs in the grave, it belongs in the hearts and minds of people.&#x201D; -Josh Hotsenpiller</em><strong>Spread the wisdom</strong>Currently brands are using the videos for a variety of purposes. <a href=\"https://www.unicef.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">UNICEF</a> recently contracted Wisdom Capture to launch one of their global training platforms in which their top 20&#x2013;30 global directors share their wisdom with UNICEF&#x2019;s fifteen thousand employees, helping them disseminate education from the top, down. And <a href=\"https://www.unilever.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Unilever</a> commissioned Wisdom Capture to film executives from several of their core brands to share their values with industry insiders, curious consumers, network and trade partners, and employees.Small and medium companies are also using Wisdom Capture to bring their emerging leadership teams together with their seasoned executive teams to answer the same question with the intention of learning from each other:<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qR9VmpmiWPY\" width=\"500\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>At Bulldog, we&#x2019;re strong believers in adopting a student-style mindset and striving to be smarter every day.

       "content_body":"Writing a blog carries with it, or should carry, the responsibility of having something useful to share. So when I sat down to write an article titled, BE YOUR BEST AT BEING THE WORST, I wondered how I could use words to convince you, the reader, to strive to be the worst person at your job.I&#x2019;ll explain in a moment.After sitting motionless at the keyboard for about an hour, it finally dawned on me that the best way to write an article about the virtues of being the worst is to actually <em>be</em> <em>the worst</em> at explaining the concept.Still with me? Really? Good.To be the worst, I thought it best to base the article on a quote from a person who easily outshines me. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Ogilvy-Advertising-David/dp/039472903X\" target=\"_blank\">David Ogilvy</a>, one of the most listened to pioneers of modern advertising and author of <em>Ogilvy on</em> <em>Advertising</em>&#x2014;one of the most read books on the industry&#x2014;has been quoted to have said, &#x201C;If each of us hires people who are smaller than we are, we shall become a company of dwarfs. But if each of us hires people who are bigger than we are, we shall become a company of giants.&#x201D;The quote speaks for itself and has been an axiom in businesses&#x2014;from advertising to anvil making&#x2014;since it was first published. I could stop here. However, in an effort to elevate my own worst-standing by just a bit, I&#x2019;ll elaborate.Even though Mr. Ogilvy&#x2019;s insight applies broadly to life as well as to business, if we stick with just two business points-of-view, the benefits of being the worst will become clear.We&#x2019;ll start with the first point-of-view: the new employee.The business landscape is changing. Today, a person just out of college doesn&#x2019;t necessarily have to settle for starting out in the mailroom (with all due respect to &#x2018;80s movies). Now, more than ever, &#x201C;new-blood&#x201D; has a lot to offer&#x2014;fresh ideas, unique cultural perspectives and, in many cases, technical acumens that far outshine those of their predecessors.However, by definition, a person just starting out has less global experience than his or her colleagues. It goes without saying that regardless of the neo-skill sets these newbies might bring to the table, they certainly still have a lot to learn.In this case, the new employee would do well to take Mr. Ogilvy&#x2019;s comment to heart: regardless of how good you might be, be better at surrounding yourself with people who are better than you&#x2014;be the best at being the worst and you can only improve.Easy, right? Now on to the second point-of-view: the seasoned veteran.As I understand it, this is actually the person Mr. Ogilvy was speaking to. While few would argue that someone just beginning their career should make an effort to learn from others, too often the same philosophy doesn&#x2019;t seem to be applied by those who&#x2019;ve already made their bones&#x2014;moreover, those with authority.The business world can be exceptionally competitive. Sometimes, a natural response to that atmosphere is to make sure that anyone about to shine gets quickly covered with a very thick blanket. It might be done consciously or unconsciously, but it does happen. And when it happens, the person throwing the rug might benefit in the short term, but all they&#x2019;ve done is exercise authority when they should have opted for exercising responsibility.Another way to look at &#x201C;be your best at being the worst&#x201D; is this (and here&#x2019;s the point):O<em>ur greatest talent should always be the ability to cultivate the talents of those around us</em>.New or seasoned, manager or employee, it&#x2019;s a matter of healthy humility. It elevates everyone and, quite frankly, it&#x2019;s the best way to do business.I read David Ogilvy&#x2019;s quote when I was just starting out. At the time, I didn&#x2019;t get the full weight of it. And, through measured insight or just dumb luck (I&#x2019;m not sure), I took it to heart. As a new just-out-of-college designer, I wasn&#x2019;t always successful at it, but I tried to listen to those around me to learn what I could. Now as a long-out-of-college director, and still not always successful at it, I try to listen to those around me to learn what I can. It&#x2019;s a practice that has served me well and I am particularly proud of the fact that any true success I&#x2019;ve experienced in my career has been a group effort.Thank you Mr. Ogilvy.So, back to the first paragraph, I&#x2019;m obviously not advocating that you, the reader, be the worst person at your job. On the contrary, use your skills. Shine. But make it a practice to surround your self with giants. Do your level best to make those already around you <em>into</em> giants. And when everyone in the room can look around that room and say, &#x201C;I can learn something from these people,&#x201D; you&#x2019;ll then have a business <em>and</em> a career worth having. In short, be your very best at being the worst&#x2014;it&#x2019;s the best thing you can do.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Long live feedback! Enough about feedback. Feedback is dead. Here&#x2019;s some feedback for you: feedback is a red herring. Feedback is an elusive, somewhat repulsive, and often destructive tactic to direct employees towards higher performance. And by higher performance I mean sustained value creation, not directed task completion. Managers have been schooled for the past 25 years to make feedback a central aspect of their people practices, under the great intention of helping workers see where their efforts are on track and where they are not. It&#x2019;s often presented under the guise of &#x201C;development&#x201D; where employees grow and improve in their careers by knowing what they are not doing right. For the most part, I believe these efforts are intended to help people perform better, but I&#x2019;m here to suggest that the whole concept of feedback is a wild goose chase&#x2026; a fallacy built upon a foundation of misunderstanding and outdated concepts of people and work.The root of the problem can be traced to the quality of companies designed in the industrial model of work where they don&#x2019;t care much about what their people think of them. Henry Ford (who will serve as our poster child) is famously attributed with the quote &#x201C;Check your brains at the gate&#x201D; because he supposedly wanted people to simply follow established procedures and not mess up the assembly line. This worked really well back then to get consistency, scale, and efficiency but has some serious downsides for current organizations that depend on knowledge, creativity, and communication.We&#x2019;re now clearly beyond the Industrial Age and smack in the middle of the Idea Economy. And since we are now dealing with people&#x2014;not machines&#x2014;to generate value, I think it&#x2019;s imperative that we adjust our language and use better terms to describe how people behave while working together.<strong>Feedback is for robots</strong><br> According to Marshall Goldsmith, the top guru of the executive coaching world, there are only two problems with feedback: 1. People don&#x2019;t want to hear it, and 2. People don&#x2019;t want to give it. Well, that explains why we have formal processes and lots of rules to make sure feedback is given in a typical company. In his book, <a href=\"http://www.marshallgoldsmithlibrary.com/cim/What-Got-You-Here.php\" target=\"_blank\">What Got You Here, Won&#x2019;t Get You There</a>, Goldsmith provides lots of good advice and useful tips on how to manage feedback successfully. In it, he agrees that the term &#x201C;feedback&#x201D; should be changed, so he suggests we use &#x201C;feed forward.&#x201D; (Pardon me, and I mean no disrespect, but I think there&#x2019;s got to be a better term.)<em>Feedback</em> is not a human word&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a machine word. It emerged as a verb in the mid-1860s in descriptions of mechanical processes&#xA0;and in 1909, Physics Nobel laureate&#xA0;<a title=\"Karl Ferdinand Braun\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Ferdinand_Braun\" target=\"_blank\">Karl Ferdinand Braun</a>&#xA0;used the term &#x201C;feed-back&#x201D; as a noun to refer to undesired&#xA0;coupling&#xA0;between components of an electronic circuit. It jumped into the language of business organizations in the late 1970s as systems thinking began to influence management practices.You might think it&#x2019;s just semantics, but to get a more human and less robotic understanding of this situation, let&#x2019;s start with the terms we use to describe key roles people play at work in a typical industrial organization: executive, manager and employee. Executives set direction, managers direct implementation, and employees accomplish tasks. This is a &#x201C;top-down,&#x201D; or hierarchical structure, that works exceptionally well when a market opportunity is clear, a product is established, and execution at scale is the primary function of the corporation. Feedback is what happens when a manager tells an employee that his work is not aligned with the plan. This is a method of control and mimics the operations of a mechanical process perfectly (i.e. a thermostat is a feedback mechanism for a furnace).In business or life situations where creative output is required (i.e., direction is unknown or ambiguous, a sufficient answer has not been found to solve a problem, or existing tactics are no longer working effectively) a mechanical process is ineffective because there is nothing to control. These situations require human power to discover and invent a path forward&#x2014;or create.<strong>Curiosity is a positive addiction</strong><br> So here&#x2019;s another analysis of feedback. There&#x2019;s only one problem with feedback: it doesn&#x2019;t describe what creative people do at work. Creative people are <em>curious</em>. In fact, they are <em>addicted</em> to curiosity. They never stop asking questions and they use what they find out to explore the world, to learn and to grow. They can&#x2019;t help themselves. As a direction is being laid out they get antsy and before you know it, their hands go up and a question blurts out. Growth is exciting and releases positive chemicals in your body that amp you up. Often the effect comes from a simple question like, &#x201C;Why?&#x201D; In a hierarchical organization, this is shut down and the person is considered a problem because they are challenging authority. In a creative organization, questions are the fuel of forward progress.Being curious is an easy thing to imagine yourself doing. Being concerned about doing a good job, helping others, and making a difference in the world comes naturally to most of us because they are fundamental desires of being human. Even on a more basic level, being curious about how you are perceived by others is key to social survival, which is an entirely human issue.Here are some examples of questions curious people ask: What do you think? How can we make these things happen? Do you have any suggestions for how I could be more successful? Curiosity is something that is innate to everyone; it&#x2019;s an attitude, a mindset, or a drive to explore and discover. However, at being <em>effectively</em> curious does take some focus and practice.<strong>Being effectively curious</strong><br> First, recognize that you can be curious along a spectrum, from immediate to long-term, and the types of questions you might ask are different for each end of the spectrum. Immediate curiosity is &#x201C;in the moment&#x201D; and long-term curiosity is more reflective and periodic. In the moment, you ask very specific questions and explore options for next steps as a result of an immediate action. A question as simple as, &#x201C;How does this feel to you?&#x201D; will bring you new insights from others in the same moment. Or you can play a little game called &#x201C;likes and wishes.&#x201D; What do you like about this? What do you wish about this? The intent behind these types of questions is to explore and expand, not to confirm or deny. That&#x2019;s being curious versus being defensive or obsessive.Occasionally, you step back to see if you are making progress toward a longer-term goal by asking questions about patterns in your experience. This is the long-view about big picture things in your life or business. In this mode, you are asking, &#x201C;Is this really what I should be doing with my time?&#x201D;Second, you need to make it easier for others to satisfy your curiosity. Nobody responds well to sharp inquisition or challenging questions without a little context. A question like, &#x201C;Why&#x2019;d you do that?&#x201D; Can actually shut somebody down and provoke an answer like, &#x201C;None of your business!&#x201D; When you ask a question, help people answer you by expressing your goal, desire, or intent. This converts people to collaborators who are helping you solve a problem versus give you the answer. It also ensures that the advice you get is aligned with where you want to go. As the saying goes, &#x201C;If you don&#x2019;t know where you are going, any road will take you there.&#x201D; Without some intention, you will get such a broad array of input from others that you can&#x2019;t make sense of it.Finally, recognize that sometimes people are quite shy about sharing their thoughts because they aren&#x2019;t sure why you really need their advice, and there&#x2019;s some social risk in their sharing critical opinions. What if you get offended and your relationship is damaged by their critique? What if they get a reputation for being a jerk? Or perhaps they haven&#x2019;t noticed any issues with your approach, and they can&#x2019;t think of anything to offer. So it&#x2019;s very helpful to provide an invitation to the discussion. This serves as an opening in your own thinking and encourages others to offer more than a platitude like &#x201C;looks good!&#x201D;You&#x2019;ve probably heard someone ask, &#x201C;How am I doing?&#x201D; only to get a simple response like, &#x201C;Fine!&#x201D; This is not a valuable learning exchange, and the burden to improve it is on the <em>asker</em> of the question, not the provider of the answer. Curiosity drives you to a more involved exploration.&#xA0; If you really want to know how you are doing, you have to help someone share her opinion in a sequence of steps that lead to a meaningful exchange:1. Express intent (I&#x2019;m trying to&#x2026;)2. Disclose a concern (but I&#x2019;m concerned that&#x2026;)3. Invite input (can you help with this?)4. Explore with curiosity (how would you do it?)Do this with several people and you&#x2019;ll have a rich set of ideas to help you make good decisions and accomplish your goals, which will lead you to an ever-stronger addiction to curiosity.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"<em>&#x201C;Develop a passion for learning. If you do, you will never cease to grow.&#x201D; &#x2014; Anthony J. D&#x2019;Angelo</em>Innovation is increasingly becoming something businesses strive for, yet most cannot define. Innovation is messy and complex. It is not something that can be scripted with a predictable outcome. It involves throwing out the rules and rethinking solutions. It involves being creative and reaching beyond the 5-year calendar and targeted sales goals. It involves creating a culture that invokes passion, creativity, and thinking.Innovation is often something that is felt rather than taught. It&#x2019;s something that happens when a group of people come together to solve a problem. And it often starts at the top, and trickles down to every department of an organization&#x2014;large or small.So how do leaders go about creating an environment for innovation and innovative thinking?Let&#x2019;s start with the notion that if you can&#x2019;t lead yourself, then you can&#x2019;t lead others. This seems fairly simple, yet there are many managers, leaders, and mentors that don&#x2019;t fit in this category. I&#x2019;m not indicating that leading people or an organization is an easy task&#x2014;rather it takes discipline and sometimes re-learning and re-thinking to effectively lead in today&#x2019;s business environment.One thing many innovative organizations have in common is that their leaders are action-oriented&#x2014; meaning, they are willing to roll up their sleeves and get their hands dirty. They want to get things done, but they also want to learn and get better. This cycle of action is driven by deep passion.And, if there is one thing people want and expect from their leaders, it&#x2019;s passionate inspiration. Leaders never stop learning and this passion for learning is contagious.Leaders are proactive. They don&#x2019;t stand back and wait for situations to present themselves in order to start learning. They study history, their surroundings, other people and current situations, and they plan for the future. From the outside looking in, it&#x2019;s become very obvious that most organizational failures are due to leadership failure because these company leaders have stopped being proactive, and instead, began reacting.While there are leaders today who understand the value of learning and creating environments for others to learn&#x2014;through training, trial and error, and procedures&#x2014;I believe these aren&#x2019;t enough. Many leaders today do not practice what they preach, but innovative leaders hold themselves accountable for the outcomes they seek. This is a huge reason why most innovative leaders are&#xA0;revered by their colleagues: they drive the conversation with their actions.IBM recently asked 1,700 CEOs in 64 countries about what they want from their leaders. The three leadership traits that most mattered were the ability to focus intensely on customer needs, the ability to collaborate with colleagues, and the ability to inspire, which, in my opinion, is the game-changer.Here are five ways to always be learning:<strong>1. Learn by doing</strong>. There is no better way to learn than through action. With the rise of MOOCs, it&#x2019;s now very easy to gain new knowledge at minimal cost&#x2014;all that is needed is time. But, acquiring knowledge without doing is only half the battle. That&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s important to act, learning in the process, while uncovering personal insights. It&#x2019;s about putting ideas into action.<strong>2. Learn by asking</strong>. If you&#x2019;re not asking questions, you&#x2019;re not going to find answers. Questions open the mind, and the more questions you ask, the more insights you&#x2019;ll uncover. The best questions are those that provoke&#x2014;not with the intent of irritating, but of exploring the boundaries of what is known and unknown. Probe, and then probe some more. The only boundaries that exist are those that go unquestioned.<strong>3. Learn by networking</strong>. We all network, however it&#x2019;s not the size of the network you have that matters, but how diverse it is. To think differently and become more valuable, you need to know and understand multiple topics. You need to develop an idea network, which feeds you insights and ideas, and will keep challenging you and helping you grow.<strong>4. Learn by observing</strong>. There is much being said around you, and it has nothing to do with the words people say, but rather how they act. Listening doesn&#x2019;t just happen with your ears, but with your eyes too. True attention makes use of all of our senses, so make an effort to take a step back and soak it all in&#x2014;there is a puzzle waiting to be solved.<strong>5. Learn by sharing</strong>. Doing is great, but sharing what you&#x2019;ve learned with others is even greater. When you share your thoughts, ideas, and experiences, your influence expands dramatically, not to mention that you&#x2019;ll also learn more because others will do the same with you.Innovation certainly starts from the people at the top&#x2014;people who need to walk the walk and take responsibility into their own hands to become a champion for change.&#xA0;Curiosity is the engine of creativity and innovation, and if you can be the champion of curiosity, there is nothing that will stand in your way. Get uncomfortable, roll up your sleeves, open your eyes, ask why, then why again, and share what you&#x2019;ve learned with your network.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Men and women once wore bell bottom jeans to look cool. Think about that. Pant legs large enough to let a furry animal run up your leg and hibernate for the winter. That was the 1970s when society was clearly confused about fashion. But think of all the really smart people who wore bell bottoms because a celebrity or a successful friend or colleague wore them, thinking it would make them equally dashing and successful. The truth is that the likes of Christian Bale and Bradley Cooper looked good in massively flared pants in the movie, American Hustle, because they are charismatic, good looking guys. They could wear pretty much anything and still look good. Everyone else? I&#x2019;ll leave it to you to imagine yourself or the men you know wearing bell bottoms.Brand trends are a little like fashion trends. Some marketing guru or agency genius tries something original, hopefully based on the nature of the brand. They get the spotlight for a social media campaign, an event, a program that no one has ever seen before. Occasionally, these original efforts are spectacularly successful, like Toms&#x2019; One For One or Nike teaming with Michael Jordan and imploring us all to &#x201C;Just do it.&#x201D; Other times, the genius may be left shaking their head and looking for a new job.&#xA0;Usually that kind of success or that kind of failure is determined by whether or not the effort was authentic to the brand. And for those tempted to jump on the trend, staying authentic to their own brand is almost never a consideration.It is too easy and likely unsustainable to be a member of the herd, following the bell cow. Or to mix the metaphor, lemmings are a great example of the stupidity of following the leader over a cliff and plunging, en masse, to your death. If there is no purpose to your plan and conviction to see it through, you&#x2019;re likely to fail.So how do you achieve originality and success? For you and for your brand? Intentionality.<strong>Focus on your own game plan</strong><br>In sports, the team that focuses on their own game plan, built on their strengths, is more likely to be successful than the one responding to the other team&#x2019;s strengths. It&#x2019;s also a lot more fun. The Magic Johnson-led LA Lakers of the Showtime era may have had to adjust to deal with a bruising opponent, but they never failed to entertain in their own way.<strong>Don&#x2019;t be a copycat<br></strong>The reason a brand campaign is working for a competitor is that it is likely the product of their own specific positioning, personality and value proposition. Not anyone else&#x2019;s. Others who adopt it are going to feel inauthentic to their community and fall short of stated goals&#x2026;and it crushes your spirit. Imitation may be the greatest form of flattery, but it makes you a follower and positions you as second rate.<strong>Avoid short-term gains</strong><br>Too many people are drawn to easy money and success, thinking that following a trend means they will have instant successful. Which, as mentioned above, is pretty unlikely without authenticity. Building a brand with intention over time is more important than chasing possible short-term gains with the inherent risk of eroding your brand.<strong>Betrayal is a strong word<br></strong>And yet, that&#x2019;s how people in your brand community, especially consumers, feel when they have fallen for you and then see you behaving like a different brand. We look to build strong, emotional engagement with staff, partners, consumers and others by taking a stand to be ourselves. To commit to something. When we act differently, it feels like a betrayal.The point of strategic branding is to set yourself apart from all others. To be intentional about who you are and what you offer the world. It&#x2019;s about making choices and committing to them. It&#x2019;s about having integrity and fighting for something you believe in.So, whether we are talking about you personally standing up in a high stakes meeting and fighting for what you know to be right or fighting on behalf of your company&#x2019;s brand as you would defend a child, be intentional, be courageous. Most leaders crave and respect people who are direct, honest and challenge them to do the right thing. The result of taking a stand and committing to it is building a life or a brand of passion, power and purpose.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"The Founder and CEO, Jason Shah of <a href=\"https://do.com\">Do.com</a> shares how he creates an environment that promotes joy at work.We spend countless hours at work. Oftentimes more hours than doing the things we love with the people we love. Do what you love, love what you do, is not a mantra, but a life principle we should all put into practice.<strong>Meaningful work helps employees see that what they do every day has impact.</strong>Work is how humankind moves forward, yet many people don&#x2019;t enjoy it. Meetings are part and parcel to the lack of satisfaction at work because of how poorly they are typically run. Do.com wants to make people feel like they&#x2019;re getting more out of their everyday lives by helping them become more efficient, and ultimately, producing meaningful work that can improve our world.How many times have you walked out of a meeting and thought, &#x201C;Damn that was pointless?&#x201D;<br>Do.com is determined to change that by helping facilitate more productive meetings. They&#x2019;re helping thousands of companies around the world, like <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/meet-the-company-that-apple-google-and-facebook-use-to-run-their-meetings.html\">Facebook, Apple, and Google</a>, run better, shorter (and even less) meetings. Their software helps tackle problems like lack of follow-up, accountability and organization in meetings. They do this by bringing structure, transparency, and automation into the room.<strong>A company born to solve problems and promote efficiency.</strong>Do&#x2019;s CEO previously worked at Yammer, a collaboration product aimed at improving communication at work. In 2012, Microsoft acquired Yammer, and as with many acquisitions, the culture and communication platform grew victim to the inefficiencies seen in many large organizations. Shah saw that one of the issues causing these inefficiencies were unproductive meetings, so he funneled his frustration into creating an opportunity to solve the problem. Shah left Yammer and began his mission to rid the world of unproductive meetings&#x2013;and Do.com was born.<strong>Do.com ensures that their employees love what they do.</strong>Do&#x2019;s company culture is focused and fun. They share a strong passion for their community and the impact they have on it, and they have a healthy respect for the merit of ideas over titles or bureaucracy. As a team, Do stays hyper-focused while aligning the company towards achieving its vision, mission and goals. Do leadership focuses on connection and spirit, because they understand it marries team cohesiveness among departments and helps their people be collectively efficient and happy.The result is a team that loves their jobs at Do.com because they know they&#x2019;re part of something meaningful in the world. As a way to help their employees succeed, Do recognizes individual talents. Shah says, &#x201C;Ultimately it boils down to us understanding what motivates our employees and then responding to that in a way that is authentic to our culture.&#x201D; From a genuine <em>thank you</em> to acknowledging the impact of a new feature built by an engineer, Do ensures that their employees know their work is meaningful.&#xA0;Do helps people love their work&#x2014;<a href=\"https://do.com\">join the revolution</a>.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

And with this inevitable date comes inevitable stress, confusion and procrastination. H&amp;R Block sought to explore the experience from a number of different perspectives to create a more positive and relevant tax process for key consumer groups.Working with their innovation team, we looked at each of H&amp;R Block&#x2019;s customer segments and identified key opportunities in which they could build a better tax experience. The first opportunity area we identified was their Latino customer. When we drilled deeper into their specific needs, we found that Latino&#x2019;s often have unique concerns related to immigration issues and education questions. As a result, we designed a totally new service offering called Taxes y Multiservicios, positioning H&amp;R Block as a trusted one-stop shop for all Latino tax-related needs. To roll out this project, we helped design the new retail experience, including storefronts and interiors, the service and product offering, specific messaging and collateral materials to highlight the new service. We also introduced the &#x201C;Consejo&#x201D; designed to help advise, guide and educate customers.Taxes y Multiservicios launched in a cluster of pilot locations in Texas with tremendous success. And we&#x2019;re currently working with H&amp;R Block to optimize the tax experience for more of its customer segments.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Every &#x201C;yes&#x201D; carries a cost. We usually think that &#x201C;no&#x201D; carries the big cost, but a &#x201C;yes&#x201D; can even be more expensive than a &#x201C;no.&#x201D;Not long ago, I spent the day with a young entrepreneur whose business was growing at a phenomenal rate. The company was in a market-pull phase with incredible tailwinds and momentum.As I began to get a feel for the business and the issues facing both the founder and the enterprise, it became apparent that the biggest variable to successfully navigate over the next 18 months was the reoccurring and mounting cost of &#x201C;yes.&#x201D; That became our theme for the day. In the past year:He said &#x201D;yes&#x201D; to outside growth capital and new partners.<br>He said &#x201C;yes&#x201D; to renovating a historic building to house their cool hip offices.<br>He said &#x201C;yes&#x201D; to a surge of new employees to keep up with the business growth.<br>He said &#x201C;yes&#x201D; to a new customer segment and expanding geographic target.<br>He said &#x201C;yes&#x201D; to layering on new offerings since they were already doing them.<br>He and his wife said &#x201C;yes&#x201D; to adopting another young child.<br>He said &#x201C;yes&#x201D; to being on the elder board at his church.<br>He had pledged a lot of &#x201C;yes&#x201D; answers and now the payments were coming due.We spent the day outlining and analyzing the costs connected to all those &#x201C;yes&#x201D; decisions. There was a mounting debt of outstanding costs screaming for payment.It is an illusion to think any yes doesn&#x2019;t carry a cost. It does.I am immediately reminded of the parable from Jesus where He asks: Who says yes to building a tower without counting all the costs associated?&#x201C;Is there anyone here who, planning to build a new house, doesn&#x2019;t first sit down and figure the cost so you&#x2019;ll know if you can complete it? If you only get the foundation laid and then run out of money, you&#x2019;re going to look pretty foolish. Everyone passing by will poke fun at you: &#x2018;He started something he couldn&#x2019;t finish&#x2019; &#x201C; (Luke 14:28-30 The Message).&#x201C;The power of a promise kept&#x201D; is a phrase many people use. When I say &#x201C;yes&#x201D; to something or someone, I am inadvertently making a promise. This helps me in my thinking, in counting the cost. How many times can I really pledge &#x201C;yes&#x201D; &#x2026; at the same time? Am I a promise keeper or a promise breaker? Here are two examples to make it practical:The &#x201C;Yes&#x201D; to my wife: When I said &#x201C;yes&#x201D; at the altar to Karen, it was an incredibly good decision. It also carried a huge cost. And not just in terms of saying &#x201C;no&#x201D; to every other potential wife out there (not that there was anyone else willing to take me). I was tying myself to someone else and giving up independent control. The kids I would have, the way I would parent, the career path I would choose, the money I would make, the stresses and joys of my life, all of it and much more was tied to the &#x201C;yes.&#x201D;The &#x201C;Yes&#x201D; to a new employee: Usually, when we think of hiring a new employee, we think of what we gain. What&#x2019;s this guy going to bring to the table? How will she strengthen us where we&#x2019;re weak? But we also need to recognize the cost of saying &#x201C;yes.&#x201D;. Saying &#x201C;yes&#x201D; to new employees includes onboarding, training them, motivating them, giving them a good culture, and, of course, paying them.Those are just two examples, but there are infinite places to say &#x201C;yes,&#x201D; and all of them have a cost:The &#x201C;yes&#x201D; to my kids<br>The &#x201C;yes&#x201D; to a new job<br>The &#x201C;yes&#x201D; to a new business<br>The &#x201C;yes&#x201D; to a business deal or partnership<br>The &#x201C;yes&#x201D; to God<br>The &#x201C;yes&#x201D; to a vacation opportunity<br>The &#x201C;yes&#x201D; to a large purchase<br>The &#x201C;yes&#x201D; to a loan<br>The &#x201C;yes&#x201D; to more education<br>The &#x201C;yes&#x201D; to a friendship<br>The &#x201C;yes&#x201D; to geographic expansion<br>The &#x201C;yes&#x201D; to a new department<br>The &#x201C;yes&#x201D; to competing in a new market<br>The &#x201C;yes&#x201D; to committing to win<br>Let&#x2019;s break down any &#x201C;yes.&#x201D;To say &#x201C;yes&#x201D; means I am saying &#x201C;no&#x201D; to someone, somewhere, sometime about some thing. A &#x201C;yes&#x201D; always carries boundaries and constraints. Take a few minutes to calculate the hidden cost or the prolonged cost of &#x201C;yes.&#x201D; Sometimes you should say &#x201C;no&#x201D; to a good opportunity so you have a &#x201C;yes&#x201D; in the bank for a great opportunity. As David Allen said, &#x201C;You can say &#x2018;yes&#x2019; to anything but not everything.&#x201D; No one has an unlimited bank account of &#x201C;yes.&#x201D;<br><br>To say &#x201C;yes&#x201D; means I must stockpile some resources to fuel the later stages of the commitment or project. Calculate the cost to the end, not just the emotional start. And make sure to get all the costs in: money, time, relationships, and emotion.<br><br>Let me be clear. I am not making the case to become a &#x201C;no&#x201D; person. Those people have their own set of issues. The goal is not to say &#x201C;no,&#x201D; but simply to count the cost of the &#x201C;yes.&#x201D; And no doubt about it, yes carries a certain energy and power to it. But keep in mind that every &#x201C;yes&#x201D; carries a cost.That is why I love what Mark Twain said: &#x201C;Measure twice and cut once.&#x201D;<em>Read more from <a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/author/stephen-r-graves#filters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stephen</a>.</em><em>Original <a href=\"http://stephenrgraves.com/articles/read/much-yes-cost/?mc_cid=48562f2cc2&amp;mc_eid=d18fd140c6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post.</a></em><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

The creative department is excited, and the media and communications teams are ready to roll. You&#x2019;ve presented your PowerPoint to the company. They seemed to like it, but few questions were asked. After all, to them this is the domain of only the marketing department, isn&#x2019;t it?In the meantime you&#x2019;ve watched your company&#x2019;s culture develop. You feel good, as it&#x2019;s an extension of your own values and those you laid out for the business at its inception. But when you&#x2019;re honest with yourself, you realize that you&#x2019;ve really left things to chance, hoping your behaviors, tone and beliefs will simply rub off onto the team. And then it hits you&#x2014;your culture isn&#x2019;t in step with the direction of your brand, and now that you&#x2019;re rebranding, the gap between the two will only widen unless you do something about it.In a successful brand-driven company, brand and culture are aligned. They&#x2019;re two sides of the same coin. They&#x2019;re a shared responsibility rather than the domains of the marketing and HR leaders respectively. When aligned, they can change customer behaviors through team members&#x2019; interpretations of your company&#x2019;s values and the ways they act upon them. Don&#x2019;t underplay the power of your people&#x2014;mobilize them. If your team understands, believes in, and lives out your brand, you&#x2019;ll have the power to provide new, authentic and meaningful experiences for your customers, leading to significant growth.Alignment can be tricky, but when achieved successfully, it can have many benefits. Here are just a few:Fostering a brand-driven culture is not always an easy task. You have to bring the DNA of your brand into the daily life of every employee in a way that&#x2019;s natural and believable. You can&#x2019;t impose it, but you can give it direction so that it sustains and builds.Here are 15 key points to consider.At the end of the day, be patient. Your brand culture will develop at its own pace, but keep a watchful eye on what&#x2019;s happening on a daily basis and prepare to give it nudges when needed. Inspire, lead by example and ensure your senior leadership team always does the same.

       "content_body":"&#x201C;Your brand is the single most important investment you can make in your business.&quot;&#xA0;&#x2013;Steve ForbesBrand is misunderstood, underappreciated and very often underutilized. When brand comes up in conversation, it often carries different meanings to different people. And many executives speak the language of brand the way some of us speak a foreign language: with a limited vocabulary and a rotten accent. While being fluent in another language is helpful, not understanding the definition, and differentiating value and places to deploy it properly can be highly problematic. Despite the excellent books, many courses, and conferences dedicated to brand there&#x2019;s still confusion surrounding its meaning and how it should be operationalized even within the most sophisticated companies.&#xA0;Brand isn&#x2019;t a marketing exercise. It&#x2019;s an exercise for the entire organization. Businesses that align marketing with customer success can create significant brand loyalty, producing meaningful interactions, engaging touchpoints and authentic customer experiences.So how do you make the shift to align brand, customer acquisition and customer success? And how can customer success be achieved by marketing teams working together to build brand advocates?&#xA0;We had the opportunity to speak with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bernieborges\">Bernie Borges</a>, Marketing Strategist and Founder of <a href=\"http://www.findandconvert.com/\">Find and Convert</a>, to share his insights on the topic. He discusses how the two segments complement and where they collide.<strong>Brand is a promise. Marketing must deliver on that promise. </strong>Borges says a brand is what the customer expects of the company, the promise it makes to its customers. The customer experience is the ultimate delivery of this promise. Therefore, marketing must be in alignment with the brand&#x2019;s promise to its customers at large.Alignment must be carried throughout every aspect of the brand&#x2014;from the logo to social media engagement, to the employees delivering the customer experience. Alignment should be in place throughout the customer journey from awareness through post-purchase support.When the marketing comes from both the logo and the employees and they align with the promise of the brand, that&#x2019;s where the brand comes together to create a true connection with its customers.A great B2C example of this is <a href=\"https://www.southwest.com/\">Southwest Airlines.</a> Flying with them is easy and transparent. Their advertising and employees deliver their brand promise in a consistent and impactful way. A great B2B example of brand alignment is Avery Dennison. Among their 25,000 employees there is a concerted effort to share the company&#x2019;s values through storytelling, made possible by their <a href=\"http://www.socialbusinessengine.com/podcasts/avery-dennison-get-social-employee-ambassador/\">Get Social program</a>.How can leaders be more effective when linking brand and marketing?<strong>Leaders have to live it.</strong>If there isn&#x2019;t buy-in at the cultural level of the organization, that typically means that leaders aren&#x2019;t bought into the vision says Borges. Alignment of brand promise with the customer experience cannot be a marketing-only strategy. It must be in the DNA of the company. No marketing program can completely succeed in brand and customer alignment without authentic leadership participation.Leaders of any organization (in every department) must be living and breathing examples of the brand experience. When leaders exemplify the brand promise, they inspire employees and everyone they touch. The employees then are more likely to be inspired to deliver on the brand promise. Then, and only then, can the marketing communication that&#x2019;s intended to reinforce the brand promise succeed.&#xA0;Consider <a href=\"http://www.hubspot.com/\">HubSpot</a>&#x2019;s culture. They deliver their SaaS product in a light and fun way. Even their product&#x2019;s user interface and experience is an example of how a brand can convey its promise from the top down&#x2014;serious about its functionality, yet fun and personable.&#xA0;<strong>Defining what the customer experience is for your brand.</strong>Borges advocates social business and defines it this way: A social business is a company in any industry of any size, including non-profits, that understands that we live in a world where content plays a significant role in the way people experience the brand. And, the company embraces the culture and technology of social media to share content through social channels across the buyer&#x2019;s journey. But it&#x2019;s much more than marketing. Brands that adopt a social business mindset understand that the culture and technology of social is something that must be implemented across the entire organization, both internally and externally. In fact, in most cases a company cannot become a social business with the external market until it masters what it means to be social internally. &#xA0;&#xA0;Borges suggests a few ways to achieve social business success:1) <strong>Empower employees to be ears, eyes and mouthpieces for the brand</strong>. Give employees a platform and guardrails that they can harness through social channels. Consider these examples; giving employees a special column in the newsletter, a podcast series or video channel hosted by employees on specific areas of the business, or empower employees to create livestream videos through Periscope or Facebook, or alternate employee hosts on the company&#x2019;s Snapchat account. Harness the advocacy potential of your strongest thought-leaders to work for your brand.2) <strong>Integrate social into the sales process</strong>. Teach the sales team how to engage with customers and prospects through social channels with a focus on relationship building to engage in sales opportunities. Be sure to teach <a href=\"http://www.socialbusinessengine.com/social-business-training-and-coaching/\">best practices</a> to avoid the worst practice scenario of aggressive selling on social media.3) <strong>Create unique ways for employees to get involved.</strong> Leverage social to encourage employees to join your brand&#x2019;s advocacy for a charitable causes by integrating it into your mission or promise. Encourage employees to capture moments of community involvement through pictures, livestream video, blogging, etc. Empower employees to share those moments on social. <br> 4) <strong>Consider social as a channel to deliver customer service. </strong>Talk to your customers where they want to be spoken to including social media channels. Leverage the rapid communication methods available through Twitter, email, Facebook, instant message, phone, etc. Engage with customers in a one-on-one way to deliver on your brand&#x2019;s promise.5) <strong>Technology can bring brand and marketing together.</strong> Embrace the culture and technology of social across the entire business, by operating as a social business. Internal social collaboration is a huge way for mid to large brands to accelerate adoption of the social business mindset. The Enterprise Social Network (ESN) can leverage the experience of your employee population through cross-functioning teams, leveraging talent within an internal collaborative system. The ESN can be much more efficient than email and much more collaborative too.&#xA0;Brand has evolved from what the marketing department used to define it as in years past, to what the customer says it is today. The potential for the marketing department to harness its full value requires a strategy that spans the entire company, beginning with top leadership and flowing throughout the entire employee population.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"After years of a long-distance relationship, Ella finally decided to make the big cross country move to follow her fianc&#xE9; to San Diego, leaving behind her other love, Miller, her Pitbull, in Florida. But don&#x2019;t worry about him&#x2014;he&#x2019;s living his best life with her parents and a huge backyard close to the beach. Ella is up for pretty much anything, like eating at new restaurants, sipping new cocktails, and visiting new countries (she aims for one new country a year), but she won&#x2019;t do any of it without a cup of coffee first. She lives by the sage advice, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t be an idiot,&#x201D; as spoken by the oh-so wise Dwight Schrute, and we&#x2019;re happy to say she applies this same no-nonsense approach to her work. Ella is self-motivated, detail oriented and super efficient, bringing her strong project management skills to our office. She&#x2019;s lent her talents to projects like Bumble Bee Seafoods, Inari Agriculture, and Mazda USA to name a few.Ella joined the Bulldog Drummond team as a Project Manager a few months ago and we found it proper to welcome her with the obligatory series of getting acquainted questions.<strong>Where are you from (&amp; how&#x2019;d you get here)?<br></strong>I grew up in Florida and then moved to New York City after college.I landed in California in January 2018. My fianc&#xE9; is a pilot in the Navy, stationed here in San Diego, so after a few years of long distance, I decided to make the move and join him on the west coast.<strong>Personality in a nutshell (how would your friends describe you)?<br></strong>I&#x2019;m actually fairly quiet until I get to know people. I&#x2019;m generally laid back and very caring, but I like to have fun and I&#x2019;m super competitive.<strong>Likes: </strong>I love my sweet pitbully, Miller. He&#x2019;s back home with my parents in Florida and I miss him like crazy&#x2014;but he&#x2019;s living his best life with a big backyard close to the beach.<strong>What are your hobbies/interests?</strong><br>Traveling, trying new foods, cocktail experimenting/wine tasting, puzzles <em>(The New Yorker, specifically)</em>.<strong>Why are you good at what you do?<br></strong>I&#x2019;m a very quick, but an efficient and detailed worker. I owe a lot of that to my time in NYC&#x2014;and to some really great bosses and clients. I gained so many invaluable skills working in fast-paced agencies that had high expectations for precision and accuracy.I love working in a collaborative and creative environment&#x2014;it&#x2019;s so inspiring. I think creatively, and I have a good eye, but I can&#x2019;t execute&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s why I ended up on the project management side of things!<strong>What gets you out of bed every day?</strong><br>Nothing before coffee! Post-coffee, every day is different&#x2014;and I love that. I have a very happy life with my fianc&#xE9;. We are constantly planning new trips and working hard to make them a reality. My family has been so supportive my whole life, so it&#x2019;s very motivating to work hard, make them proud and assure them that all of their sacrifices weren&#x2019;t for nothing.<strong>What&apos;s the best advice you&apos;ve ever been given?</strong><strong><br></strong><em>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t be an idiot.&#x201D; &#x2013;Dwight Schrute</em><strong>Favorite quote:</strong><br><em>&#x201C;There is nothing permanent except change.&#x201D; &#x2013;Heraclitus</em><strong>What you&#x2019;re reading:</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Ill-Be-Gone-Dark-Obsessive/dp/0062319787\"><em>I&apos;ll Be Gone in the Dark: One Woman&apos;s Obsessive Search for the Golden State Killer</em></a><strong>Best place in New York to eat?</strong><br>I could never pick just one!

Their executive leadership team recognized the market was changing and they were switching from a company-owned to franchisee-centric business model so they needed to look at their brand from a new perspective. For the past two years we worked closely with the executive and operational leadership teams to position their brand and internal culture for this shift. Working collaboratively with their team, a new vision, mission and set of defining values was carefully crafted.Working from this foundation, we&#x2019;ve helped inform and reshape their entire brand platform. It was introduced throughout the company in a series of Brand Immersion summits using a variety of tools, one of which was The Book of Jack&#x2014;an internal brand guide to help inspire and guide employees and business partners.The books design conveys the future-forward mission while incorporating logos and brand colors to maintain a strong brand connection.&#xA0;The Jack in the Box logo inspired the shape of the guide and was also used to create a graphic background element to create visual interest. Messaging hierarchy to highlight key phrases and principles is established using varying weights of type.

       "content_body":"It&#x2019;s little spark of inspiration that ignites every morning when we wake. Thoughts begin to swirl and questions pop into our brains: will this be the 40-foot wave at Mavericks or the nice slow long 10-foot curl in Malibu? Will my favorite team win? Will the weather really be 75 and sunny as promised? No one can really predict what will happen, and that is what makes life so very interesting&#x2014;the unknown. The old saying, &#x201C;it is a big wide wonderful world out there&#x201D; seems more apropos today than ever. We&#x2019;re surrounded by options and experiences that are seemingly at our disposal, like reading the paper while drinking a hot cup of coffee or tea, driving an electric car, or even flying into outer space. In most cases, we are the only limiting factor. Limitations are often self-imposed, and can prevent us from growing&#x2014;however limitations can also fuel passion and encourage us to learn more and more each day.<br><br><strong>Always be learning</strong><br>We gather information daily in a variety of ways through a variety of channels. However when we break down how we obtain knowledge it&#x2019;s usually done through three prime areas: work, pleasure, and &#x201C;other,&#x201D; and often learned through books, people, the web, television, interaction, and day-to-day experiences. In doing this, people learn how to deal with new environments, adapt to situations, problem-solve and perhaps more importantly, how to deal with each other.<br><br>How we synthesize information will ultimately determine how each one of us acts and reacts in the world. We must not put too much emphasis on how or where we obtain knowledge, but rather the knowledge gained to deliver. There is little question that in today&#x2019;s fast paced society, gaining knowledge is not only about success, but also survival.<br><br><strong>What you consume consumes you</strong><br>While news did not travel fast in the time of Socrates, today things happen at lightening speed&#x2014;information travels and spreads across the globe with the click of a button, and within seconds we&#x2019;re able to obtain information in previous decades took days, weeks, and sometimes months. It&#x2019;s often difficult to focus our learning to one subject with so many pressing topics requiring our attention, not to mention getting bombarded by unidirectional information. Most of us are also put under a great amount of external pressure. Being aware of what is going on around us is expected now more than ever because information is at our fingertips. Curation is essential. Time is at a premium and how we filter unwanted and unneeded information is the key factor in successfully acquiring knowledge. We must not only be good time managers, but also synthesize and curate information in an efficient manner.<br><br><strong>Creative arts enhance our ability to learn</strong><br>Currently there is a big push into STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) to elevate our K-12 educational system, but we must also be cognizant to the fact that the arts play a key role in the creative thinking process. Art at its core is about emotion. One visit to the Sistine Chapel in Rome will convey Michelangelo&#x2019;s message of beauty and power. While reading from one of the famous western philosophers like Thales helps expose basic emotions, such as love, hate, joy, and bliss, and provides a deeper understanding of human behaviors. The creative arts (painting, sculpture, drawings, film, and writing) are all about expression teaching us all a very important in the way we act and also react.<br><br>Looking within allows us to better adapt and deal with our environment. It also enables us to be better time and information managers, which is a necessary in today&#x2019;s data-intense society. Our prime learning channels&#x2014;work, pleasure, and &#x201C;other&#x201D;&#x2014;are all very different, yet all interrelated. How we engage, access, synthesize, and curate information will determine how we deal with the real world. Each person is different and synthesizes and retains information at different rates, but the more we learn, the richer our lives become and the more we contribute to the world around us.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

It fuels a brand&#x2019;s reason for being; it fuels why founders and their teams get up every morning; it fuels why they do what they do.About six months ago we met Cliff. Cliff is a no nonsense guy with tattoos, a bigger than life presence and a sharp wit. For over two decades he built custom cars. But his heart just wasn&#x2019;t in it&#x2014;so after 25 years he walked away from his career to follow his true passion, soup. (Yes, soup) He sold his successful shop and his tricked-out cars to follow his dream of making soups using only wholesome and organic ingredients inspired by his family and his love of good food. Cliff refuses to compromise his vision or the quality and taste of his products. We all fell in love with Cliff, his passion and of course, his soup.We worked with Cliff to help him craft a brand that would bring soup back to the kitchen table. We named the brand, developed the voice, and created the brand identity, the overall look &amp; feel, and the packaging which features photographs of real people who represent a time when consumers valued real food, real farms and small batch preparation. The bright colors pop against the black &amp; white photographs and the bold type is a modern twist on traditional values.While Cliff&#x2019;s unique jar and label help him stand out in a crowded retail space, and his recipes will have your taste buds craving more, it&#x2019;s his passion that positions this soup above the competition.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

We spent time talking through the big questions we all face and the meaning of life with our friend Dick Savidge, the ultimate outdoor adventure guide and professional counselor.On Saturday morning&#xA0;we started out on a snowshoe adventure into the wilderness that would take us to 13,000 ft. We looked at the map and picked a route up, prepared the equipment we needed, and like life, we knew where we wanted to end up. What we couldn&#x2019;t plan for were the variables and challenges along the way&#x2014;we had no idea what tree wells we might fall into, and no idea just how serene and beautiful the scenery would be on our path to the summit.We hiked through the snow, taking one step in front of the next, as snowshoes don&#x2019;t allow you to do anything more. As we made every effort not to slide down the mountain path, I was reminded that snowshoeing along mountainous ridge lines on hard and then soft snow is analogous to our journey through life. We need to pay attention to the importance of each step we take or we&#x2019;re likely to end up in the wrong place. With each step on the mountain there was silent time to think and reflect, and look at the breathtaking surroundings.&#xA0;As we climbed out of the tree line and the summit became dauntingly visible, the work it was going to take to get there became clear. There&#x2019;s nothing quite like a mountain to put life in perspective, but we were going to the top and it was going to be a hard climb. Each step required determination and perseverance at 12,000 ft and the reward of getting to the top made&#xA0;me appreciate all of the steps it took to reach the summit. If we focus on the destination and ignore the importance of each step, we miss out on the very journey itself.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

We love them, spoil them, and of course, feed them the very best foods. That&#x2019;s why we love <a href=\"http://www.thehonestkitchen.com\" target=\"_blank\">The Honest Kitchen</a>, a human-grade food formulated especially for your pet&#x2019;s optimal nutrition.As a longtime client and partner, The Honest Kitchen came to us looking to refresh their existing packaging to make sure they are communicating their messaging loud and clear. Our first step in the redesign process was to meet with the passionate owners to truly understand what&#x2019;s important to them when purchasing pet food and what they look at for on the packaging. Next, we investigated the current market to see what pet owners are faced with when scanning pet store shelves. Using the insights gathered, as well as The Honest Kitchen&#x2019;s mantra that all pets should eat proper food, we got to work.We looked at revising the messaging hierarchy and developing a design language that emphasizes the culinary nature of the food. Each ingredient is prominently displayed on the front of the packaging for quick consumer recognition. And a &#x201C;Just Add Water&#x201D; icon was created to illustrate the natural method of preparation. Using a carefully selected mix of fonts, hand-drawn ingredients, illustrated pet silhouettes and playful language we established a sincere and lighthearted tonality that directly reflects the personality of The Honest Kitchen brand.We created the new packaging line with consumer shopping behavior at the center. We designed the boxes so they can be merchandised as a cohesive set with all fronts together for maximum visual impact on-shelf &#x2013; and a combination of fronts and sides to draw consumers in to read and explore further.The result? The newly refreshed packaging is unlike anything you&#x2019;ll see on pet food store shelves today. The feedback has consistently been that all of our early stage insights and objectives have indeed been accomplished. The Honest Kitchen has experienced an upswing in new product orders from both existing and new retailers.And judging from all the empty dog bowls here at Bulldog&#x2019;s office, our pets think it tastes great too.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

This vision soon became a passion, a driving force and a reality&#x2014;and SHE-CAN was born.As our world continues to get smaller, raising a global generation of capable and gutsy female leaders is critical to systemic change. That&#x2019;s why SHE-CAN seeks out smart, ambitious and low-income young women in Rwanda, Afghanistan and Cambodia and provides them with a U.S. college education, mentorship and leadership training for a truly transformative journey. Each scholar can return home a leader and ignite change in her own country.<strong>BRAND ARTICULATION</strong>SHE-CAN came to Bulldog to help them fully develop their brand as they continue to grow and create even more impact. After learning their mission and goals, together we articulated their organization&#x2019;s purpose, vision and process. Fueled with their mission and vision, we brought their cause to life through compelling stories and a unique brand voice.<strong>LOGO &amp; STYLE GUIDE</strong>Our next step was to create a new logo and visual style that was in line with their new brand voice. The logo is bold and direct, symbolizing strength, and the illustrated arrow behind &#x201C;CAN&#x201D; emphasizes the potential in each student, while focusing on the future and progress. Reflecting the lines of the logo, the angled images and blocks of color represent each student&#x2019;s individual story and her &#x201C;angle&#x201D; on life, and create visual interest while highlighting their unique stories. The overall color palette evokes a sense of hope, optimism and brightness that aligns with all areas of their organization.While SHE-CAN currently provides opportunities for young women in Afghanistan, Cambodia and Rwanda, they strive to reach out to even more countries to create a steady flow of connected and courageous young women who will help change the face of their nations&#x2014;and through that&#x2014;the world.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span><em>Photo: <a href=\"http://instagram.com/garrett_patz\" target=\"_blank\">Garrett Patz</a></em>"

       "content_body":"When the world no longer seems to make sense, when it looks like what was once unacceptable has become commonplace, it is easy to surmise that we are on a downward spiral to mediocrity and have lost our collective sense of purpose. There is, however, a glimmer of hope. As humans, we are driven by the fact that there is meaning in the individual, in who we are and in the things we do.&#xA0;From a personal perspective, I think that living with purpose gives people a sense of belonging &#x2013; an awareness of our journey and hope for what lies ahead. When we have a clear purpose in our lives we can firmly hold on to the belief that we can, and will, achieve our goals.<strong>Purpose Drives Success</strong>In business, purpose brings clarity and focus to a company and its team, from leadership all the way down the ladder. Without purpose, leaders struggle to succeed as they often have greater difficulty reaching their goals, instilling confidence and meeting their company&#x2019;s objective. On the other hand, with a clear purpose leaders are able to successfully guide their brands, attain their objectives and keep customers coming back for the value their brands offer.&#xA0;Purpose also drives profit. In their book, <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Corporate-Culture-Performance-John-Kotter/dp/1451655320\" target=\"_blank\">Corporate Culture And Performance,</a></em> John Kotter and James Heskett describe how purposeful companies are more profitable over a long period of time. To truly attain this success, everything from developing a new idea to hiring a new employee to marketing the brand must reflect the purpose of the company and its mission.<span style=\"font-weight: normal !msorm;\"><strong>To </strong></span><strong>Be Purpose-Driven Requires Exceptional Discipline and Focus<span style=\"font-weight: normal !msorm;\">&#xA0; </span></strong>An example of a company driven by a clear purpose is <a href=\"http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Doctors without Borders</a> (M&#xE9;decins Sans Fronti&#xE8;res), whose mission involves working in nearly 70 countries providing medical aid to those most in need, regardless of their race, religion or political affiliation. This narrative has no ambiguity; it propels their volunteers to join the cause and to fulfill the purpose&#x2013;to help those who need medical attention whenever the need arises. Their purpose provides a way for talented medical practitioners to carry out their vocation and make a difference.<strong>Purpose Drives Commitment to Something Greater</strong>Some years ago I watched <a href=\"http://www.hbo.com/john-adams\" target=\"_blank\">the HBO series on the life of John Adams</a>. One of the aspects of his life that stuck with me was his relentless and urgent sense of purpose, which was passed on to the entire Adams family. Although not all the children had his determination, his son, John Quincy Adams, carried on his father&#x2019;s purpose-driven legacy and went on to become the sixth President of the United States.&#xA0;But Adams&apos; legacy and sense of enduring purpose did not come without sacrifice. John Adams&#x2019; commitment to his country and political career was costly. In the early years, most of his time was spent on the road in Philadelphia with the Continental Congress working on independence from England and the Constitution. Later he went on to spend time in Europe on behalf of the New Republic. &#xA0;Today we see a similar sense of commitment and sacrifice by many who come to our shores as immigrants seeking a better life for their children and the generations to come. Their resolve and mission are what we as a country are all about&#x2013;one generation driven by a shared commitment to create a better life for the next generation, passed down ad infinitum. The specifics involved in that commitment may vary from generation to generation, but ultimately it stems from the same purpose, leaving our family, our country, and our world better than we found it.<strong>Purpose Begins with the Individual</strong>In an election year, most of us tend to look for direction from leaders in the political and corporate realm, but a purpose-driven life begins with an introspective look at our own devotion, self-determination, intention and insight. It starts with cultivating knowledge of self and recognizing that there is more to life than just the daily grind&#x2013;that there is a bright future ahead and that the sun will rise again.&#xA0;So be bold. Live a life of purpose; choose your vision well since you may find yourself living it for a very long time. Do not give up on your mission, have unwavering faith that with enough effort and drive you will succeed.&#xA0;The road you take to achieve your purpose may be challenging, but stay the course, it will be the necessary refining process to a great testimony.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Now that you&#x2019;ve blown up your January resolutions, let&#x2019;s focus on real ways you can act differently from February on!<br><br><em>10 ways to do&#x2026;</em><em>25 simple things to try when&#x2026;</em><em>293 different ways to change your&#x2026;</em>I&#x2019;m sure the advice is helpful, but chances are that if you read a handful of these, the articles will start to contradict each other.<em>Be intentional in making decisions. / Don&#x2019;t think, act.</em><em>Cram more in. / Strip more away.</em><em>&#xA0;</em><em>Choose &#x201C;yes&#x201D; always. / Say &#x201C;no&#x201D; more often.</em><em>Spend more time alone. / Spend more time with others.</em>Most to-do lists reflect what worked in the writer&#x2019;s life&#x2014;in their circumstances, at a particular time. In other words, the &#x201C;to-dos&#x201D; may not be right for you, and they may not work for you. With that in mind, I want to humbly offer you five verbs to consider as you journey through the year.Since<em> we are what we repeatedly do</em>, the habits you create in 2018 will set the stage for a brilliant 2019. I won&#x2019;t promise that these words will change your life&#x2014;that&#x2019;s up to you. But, I am certain you&#x2019;ll create more opportunities for meaningful moments.<strong>Stand<br></strong>End indifference to things that matter. Consider what you stand for and speak up (and out) about it. Don&#x2019;t be a mugwump. Have an opinion and share it, respectfully. If others are offended, that is their choice to make.<strong>Notice<br></strong>Bring forth your inner Thoreau&#x2014;see, hear, taste, smell and touch (with permission) what&#x2019;s around you. I&#x2019;m always fascinated when I go on a hike with my wife. I&#x2019;m typically a &#x201C;get to the top as fast as you can&#x201D; guy, and because of that I miss so much. She finds the small flowers, the animal prints and the hatch from Lost simply by choosing to notice.<strong>Praise<br></strong>We often hold back praise because of our own inadequacies, not the inadequacies of others. If people do great stuff (even if you think they are supposed to) let them know. I&#x2019;m not talking about puffing someone up unnecessarily, but there is nothing wrong with telling someone they did something pretty rad.<strong>Risk<br></strong>I dig Eleanor Roosevelt&#x2019;s quote, &#x201C;<em>Do one thing every day that scares you.</em>&#x201D; Risk isn&#x2019;t always about doing something scary, but it does come with uncertainty. Be proactive in taking risks&#x2014;not dumb risks but not ones that are too safe either. It could mean walking down an unfamiliar street, becoming the newbie in a group or talking to a stranger&#x2014;or it can be something completely unique to you.<strong>Guffaw <br></strong>Whether in polite or impolite company, don&#x2019;t stifle laughter. This world needs more laughter, or more specifically, more loud, boisterous laughter. So, practice your guffaw and deploy it at will. I guarantee it will make the world a better place, if only for a moment, and that&#x2019;s plenty long enough.Again, these verbs won&#x2019;t necessarily change your life, but if they lead to you acting differently than you did before you read them, then they will be a catalyst for something. As a wise man once said, &#x201C;No change, no change&#x201D;.Cheers to 2019!&#xA0;<em>Written while listening to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/event/music/577093037/ahi-tiny-desk-concert\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AHI</a>.</em><em>Read more from <a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/author/mark-tomaszewicz#filters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mark</a>.&#xA0;</em><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Be the change you want to see in the world.There it is, so simple, a formula for making a difference in the world. To quote a great American brand, &#x201C;Just do it&#x201D;.There&#x2019;s a lot of truth to that statement, and a lot of na&#xEF;vete.In an age ensorcelled with all that is new, shiny, groundbreaking, and forward-thinking, it&#x2019;s easy to forget that innovation isn&#x2019;t limited to only the tangible. Some of the most needed and complicated innovations relate to the ways in which our longstanding institutions operate.Having built my career in the world of higher education, I have a deep appreciation for the traditions and strengths of colleges and universities. There&#x2019;s a reason people come from around the world to study in the U.S. But failing to evolve has put those very institutions under an uncomfortable public microscope in recent years, and my corner of that world, the liberal arts, has been subject to the most probing scrutiny of all.Not a month goes by without a politician, pundit, or publication calling into question our very existence. The study of philosophy, the arts, my degree in English, all come under fire. They are frivolous. There are no jobs. It&#x2019;s welders vs. philosophers in a presidential debate courtesy of Marco Rubio. It&#x2019;s patently false, but we hear it again and again.<em>Fast Company</em> cited a recent PayScale survey in which hiring managers bemoaned the lack of critical thinking, problem solving, and writing proficiency among new college graduates. Those skills are the cornerstone of a liberal arts education. And yet the narrative is that there aren&#x2019;t jobs if you pursue a course of study that develops those skills.So why the disconnect? Because change hurts.Leading innovation in an industry built on, and sustained by, its traditions is no easy task. Simply putting the shiny and new atop deeply entrenched systems isn&#x2019;t innovation. It&#x2019;s a band-aid. People who love the liberal arts feel threatened. They circle the wagons to protect the disciplines they love, to save them from a world that doesn&#x2019;t understand. But the effort to defend has exactly the opposite effect. Circling the wagons, being isolated from the world outside the academy, and choosing not to evolve and engage weakens us.But change hurts.It&#x2019;s not enough to be the change you want in the world. That&#x2019;s too isolated. It&#x2019;s singular. It doesn&#x2019;t pull anyone else along for the ride.If you are innovating, working hard to move an established organization in a new direction and making change, then be prepared. When you care deeply about the change you&#x2019;re making, that it&apos;s right and that you get it right, it&#x2019;s stressful. Reaching toward your goals will mean moving away from the status quo and taking your employees from what&#x2019;s established and safe to something new and untried. The impact on the people around you will be significant.If it doesn&#x2019;t tear at your heart, if it doesn&#x2019;t hurt, if you don&#x2019;t sometimes pause to question what you&#x2019;re doing and if it truly is the right thing, then you may not be pushing enough to create transformative change. If you care enough to rebuild it, at some point you&apos;ll be forced to break apart something you love. And it will be painful.Let your call to action be this: Be the change that makes you weep in the world.Having the courage to innovate doesn&#x2019;t mean you won&#x2019;t cry. It means after you cry, you won&#x2019;t stop.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

Building a brand with an authentic purpose is even more difficult.&#xA0;Caddis is a brand born from an authentic passion to fulfill a need in the world while sending an important message to embrace aging. A sort of anti-marketing strategy. Tim Parr, the founder of Caddis, realized he needed reading glasses, but when he went looking for a solution he felt that nothing existed that suited his needs. &#x201C;<em>It was either buy $20 drugstore granny glasses, or spend $200+ at an optical store&#x201D;,</em> Needless to say, he didn&#x2019;t relate to either option and thought that he couldn&#x2019;t be the only one thinking that the glasses-buying consumer experience was in need of an overhaul.After digging deeper he found that 90% of people over age 40 develop Presbyopia&#x2014;blurry vision at close distances. The problem is that lifestyle brands fail at directly targeting people over 40 and as Tim reminds us <em>&#x201C;buying reading glasses sucks because of it&#x201D;.</em> Age should not exclude audiences from relevant product experiences.&#x201C;<em>Socially and culturally we have a twisted point of view on aging. Caddis is going to change that.&#x201D; -Tim Parr</em>Caddis is the anti- anti-aging brand, that&#x2019;s their stance. They are on a mission to initiate open and honest conversations about how absolutely right it is to be the age you are, right here and now. &#x201C;<em>In spite of the fact that the entire world seems hell-bent on marketing to our long-gone teen vanities or trying to scare us into an early grave.&#x201D;</em> says Tim.Here are a few inspiring principles Tim uses to run his company.<strong>Blow your own damn mind<br></strong>While researching what he wanted this brand to be, he and his team heard repeatedly that reading glasses need to be small, lightweight, foldable, have hundreds of styles, be inexpensive and available in lots of colors&#x2026;. so they did the exact opposite. This complete disregard to the status quo drives how they approach design and innovation.<strong>Design is a business strategy<br></strong>Knowing that their audience has a high level of design sensibility and expectations, they drive visual beauty into everything that they do.<strong>Talk the walk<br></strong>Caddis embraces age well beyond simply providing a product. They&#x2019;ve created an entire platform dedicated to life beyond the age of 40. <em>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s where we want to tell a more complicated and more accurate story about people.&#x201D;</em> Tim explains. Caddis has partnered with musicians and celebrities over 40 to share this message with songs like <a href=\"https://caddislife.com/pages/donavon-frankenreiter\">Change is Good</a> by Donavon Frankenreiter and Taylor &amp; Sybil Steele talking about <a href=\"https://caddislife.com/pages/taylor-sybil-steele\">Looking Forward</a>.<strong>Kill the ego<br></strong>We all get older. Tim says that too often people fear looking dumb or being judged. <em>&#x201C;It drives me crazy when I hear an adult talk about how they tried something new but they&#x2019;re no good at it, so they quit after a few false starts. Watch third grade kids learn a musical instrument and see how little they care about what you think and how they sound. But no matter what, they show up the next day and keep at it. It&#x2019;s awesome. Learn from grade school kids.&#x201D;</em><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span><em>Photo: <a href=\"https://caddislife.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Caddis</a></em>"

       "content_body":"Many articles have been written about marketing and the move to create global brands. However, little tends to be written about brands as they fit into a globalized environment and localization around category and sub-category.<strong>The Big Brand Dilemma<br> </strong>Consider Nike. Most people understand what Nike stands for and can recognize the &#x201C;swoosh&#x201D; logo. Typically, the best form of flattery in the industry is that there is an industry built around copying and counterfeiting similar products. Yet where Nike stands on a day-to-day sales basis, things are very different. The Nike brand has sub-brands that need to be localized for various markets. For example, Nike will have rock climbing, cycling and rugby customers within Spain, Catalonia and South America, which require recognition at the brand level, but also at category and sub-category levels. Nike will need to learn and understand these geographic areas, social standards and communities, and create brand messaging that suits their local language. There are many global companies whose product launches have failed due to improperly addressing cultural sensitivities.<strong>Specialized Products, Delivered Locally<br> </strong>So what&#x2019;s a brand to do? Where does the &#x201C;big brand&#x201D; define the process? Where do you measure? How do you provide consistency around price? What about discounts and promotions? How do you communicate in both local and global languages? With any process, there needs to be some underlying technology. For example, if you want to talk to somebody long distance, you use a telephone. The key for a big brand is delivery&#x2014;a consistent experience, regardless of category or country boundary. To communicate your message properly for a specific region, companies should employ a central working team that has local representatives. These stream leaders provide direct input into a central model, giving bottom-up input, as well as leading the implementation at the local level. Ensuring each piece of the messaging&#x2014;from the audience messaging to the marketing to the slogans&#x2014;links to the brand while communicating properly to that region.A social media listening and market influence program should be implemented at the country level (in local language) so the team can learn and change. The B2C market and social media is a fast-paced set of medium&#x2014;consumer attitudes are always changing the project, and stakeholders need to understand this is not a point in time but a journey.<strong>And Finally&#x2026;<br> </strong>Big brands offer companies a global vision, but this is not the &#x201C;real world.&#x201D; Customers want small niche brands, personalization and localization. While big brands are important, revenue and profit is created at category and sub-category levels. The battle within companies is the need for centralized control and recognizing that it&#x2019;s not &#x201C;business as usual&#x201D; through the democratization of information in the new Social World. Big brands rule, but small brands pay the rent. Communication and consensus is key. While I&#x2019;m not advocating a committee-heavy structure, there has to be centralized control and local buy-in. The <em>Pareto principle </em>applies. Go live with a plan and authority to manage locally. Be ready to change and keep changing&#x2014;the social customer is a fickle creature and you need to keep up.<em>&#xA0;</em><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Standing out in a crowd isn&#x2019;t always easy. But it comes with big rewards for the passionate. Society tends to pressures people and businesses to be the same, that blending-in is better. Though acculturating may bring success day-to-day, for businesses to stay relevant they must be interesting&#x2014;standing out gets noticed but it&#x2019;s true passion that sustains.<strong>LET YOUR PASSION SPEAK FOR ITSELF</strong>In a genre that has seen decades of ingenuity, saturation and movement away from the techniques and styles that defined generations, I had the opportunity to experience inventiveness and an alternate route through the dissection of music. The stage for the <a href=\"http://djshadow.com/announcing-renegades-of-rhythm-tour-this-fall-w-cut-chemist/\">Renegades of Rhythm tour</a> consisted of a platform with six turntables, a cardboard cutout of New York City&#x2019;s skyline and two boxes of records patiently waiting their turn. Two turntablists emerged on the stage and introduced themselves as <a href=\"http://djshadow.com\">DJ Shadow</a> and <a href=\"http://cutchemist.com\">Cut Chemist</a>. For the next two hours, they went on to spin a narrative of the genre-defining influences, artistry, and social charge of the legendary hip hop icon <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/afrika-bambaataa/biography\">Afrika Bambaataa</a>. It was a two-hour sound documentary that left me inspired and connected to the turntablists as musical scientists, artists and historians.<strong>DESIGN THE ALTERNATE ROUTE</strong>This unique experience influenced a few questions: <em>How can music be innovative? </em>And,<em> what hasn&#x2019;t been done?</em> With the emergence of technology, music has evolved over the past few decades and continues to evolve every day. Through this evolution, musicians are challenged and encouraged to think creatively to pave new roads by exploring unique sounds, techniques and styles. Music can be seen as an accelerated microcosm of brands in other industries. The qualities of music that have defined great artists of the past and present can be translated across any field. They&#x2019;ve set themselves apart and proven their authenticity through a passion for their craft. It may seem like an impossible task to create something new when it appears everything great has already been accomplished, but an alternate route is reserved for the bold, built on a foundation of uncertainty. This is the work of true innovators like DJ Shadow and Cut Chemist.<strong>PASSION IS ADDICTIVE. DIG DEEP.</strong>DJ Shadow and Cut Chemist are examples of artists and innovators who are fueled by a passion to share something they love with the world. They practice their craft because they believe in it&#x2014;and through their efforts they find unique compositions and sounds. Known in the DJ world as &#x201C;crate diggers&#x201D;, they&#x2019;ve spent countless hours scouring thousands of old and new records all over the world in search of unique sounds and beats&#x2014;details that could easily be missed but are religiously chronicled in their minds. The majority of DJs rely heavily on computers and special effects to mix one song into another, whereas more skilled turntablists incorporate learned techniques such as scratching, blending and beat juggling to combine or separate samples of songs that create unique compositions. Whether it&#x2019;s creating a new product, service or sound, passion leads to innovation, so dig deep because passion can&#x2019;t be created, it comes from within. True passion is recognized and appreciated if you can find and share it with the world.<strong>REDEFINE YOURSELF WITH LESS</strong>This particular show resonated because it set itself apart from modern music. These two DJs have taken their music back to basics. No play buttons connected to advanced computers and devices were on the stage&#x2014;they simply played vinyl records on turntables attached to a mixer. The pair performed a meticulously mapped out story from Bambaataa&#x2019;s records that explored the history of hip hop through the &#x2018;60s, &#x2018;70s, &#x2018;80s to current-day hip hop through the lens of Afrika Bambaataa himself. They explored what defined Bambaataa as an artist, the influences of other music on his creations, and Bambaataa&#x2019;s influences on hip-hop as a genre as well as an entire generation. This pair is able to weave a seamless narrative without any stops from beginning to end in the most scientific way I have ever heard music being played. Systematic in its preparation, impromptu in its styling, yet staying the course to chronicle an icon in hip hop history&#x2014;familiar, yet new, all at the same time. Can you pull from your industry&#x2019;s own history and make it fresh, new and relevant? Is there room to innovate from a set of established norms? Have the confidence to stand apart from the crowd and be different. People remember compelling brands.<strong>GO BACK TO GO FORWARD&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong>Sometimes we must break through what we know in order to move forward. DJ Shadow and Cut Chemist&#x2019;s tour captivates with ingenuity and intrigue. They&#x2019;ve forged the alternate route to pay homage to the past and offer something new that will influence the next generation. They&#x2019;ve broken down music to its original components, only to build the pieces back up to create new and brilliant masterpieces. In business like in music, all brands eventually arrive at a crossroads. Changing times force brands to rethink how they can stand out in the crowded market. How do you innovate and redefine who you are to captivate new audiences? This task may seem impossible because of a lack of funding, resources, ideas, or technology. But inside special brands lie a burning passion for their craft and courage to stand apart. Use these passionate artists who redefined storytelling through sound as inspiration to go back in order to go forward. Be bold. Be courageous. Anything is possible.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

It needs to be nurtured, evolved and invigorated by the people entrusted to keep it true and alive.Culture is the environment in which your strategy and your brand thrives, or dies a slow death. Think about culture like a nurturing habitat for success. Culture cannot be manufactured&#x2014;it has to be genuinely nurtured by everyone, from the CEO down.We recently had the opportunity to sit down with <a href=\"https://www.cjcas.com/\">CJ Casciotta</a>&#x2014;a brand expert, media maker, and the author of Get Weird: Discover the Surprising Secret to Making a Difference<em>. </em>Over the past 15 years, he has helped some of the biggest brands think differently and discover their unique identity, and we talked with him about his work and the benefits of getting weird.<em>&#x201C;I was such a weird kid, always refusing to stay inside the lines. But like everyone, at some point, I got &#x2018;the weird&#x2019; kicked out of me. It seemed like the second I became an adult and entered the workforce, the qualities that once made me a misfit were the qualities that made me successful. I wrote the book because grownups need to reconnect with that weird kid they once were&#x2026;and kids need to keep being weird as they become grownups.&#x201D; - </em><a href=\"https://www.cjcas.com/\">CJ Casciotta</a><em>&#xA0;</em>CJ shared five Uncommon Principles that all brands should consider to break free from the herd and make things that matter.<strong>Cut the beef.<br></strong><em>&#x201C;Identity is more important than story. Focusing on people helps brands to operate out of their true selves. The closer a brand is to operating out of its true self&#x2014;the parts of the brand&#x2019;s soul that make it different&#x2014;the closer it is to the difference it is designed to make.&#x201D; </em><strong>Rebrand your rebrand.<br></strong><em>&#x201C;</em><em>After 15 years of working with c-level teams, I started noticing a pattern...no one was on the same page. Re-branding was a time-sucking chore versus something to get excited about. Everyone was trying to keep up with what other companies were doing. As a result, they kept churning out similar materials, but none of them were making a significant impact. As companies and brands get older, that notion seems to inevitably leak into our companies, our people, and what is communicated to the audience. It&#x2019;s much easier to model what seems to be working for others instead of doing the hard work of finding (and owning) what a brand uniquely has to say. But it&#x2019;s a trap! Apple never epitomized another computer company and Charity: Water never sought to resemble another non-profit. What made these movements so groundbreaking (and ultimately effective) was that they knew what problem they wanted to solve, discovered what the market was missing, and owned what made them uncommon amidst a sea of similar thinking.&#x201D;</em><strong>The cows go where green grass grows. And green grass grows where you water it.<br></strong><em>&#x201C;The act of articulating exactly why that unique thing the brand offers to the world is vital if we want to build a movement&#x2014;something meaningful that gathers others, grows, and eventually creates long-term cultural change.&#x201D; </em><a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/culture-eats-strategy-for-lunch\">Strong cultures empower their people</a>, they recognize their talents, and give them a very clear role with responsibilities they&#x2019;re accountable for. It&#x2019;s amazing how basic this is, but how absent the principle is in many businesses.<em>&quot;Hacking the culture may seem like victory, and in many ways it is. But it should never be viewed as a finish line. In many ways it is just the beginning. </em><em>Have you ever read a mission statement on a website or poster and thought it sounded a bit pretentious and hard to relate to? That&#x2019;s because most mission statements are written in windowless conference rooms miles and miles away from the people they are actually intended to reach. In addition, many mission statements don&#x2019;t follow a process. They&#x2019;re birthed out of guesswork and fruitless dialogue often called &#x2018;brainstorming&#x2019;. The result is cold and clinical. Any attempts to be unique, original or compelling accidentally backfire&#x2014;ostracizing the very people they are trying to influence. Without knowing it, many mission statements accidentally come off as shameful and authoritarian, declaring to one and all&#x2014;&#x2018;we know better.&#x2019;</em><em>When we choose belonging over branding however, we get out of our swivel chair and actually sit among the people we want to inspire. We stop talking at them and instead start listening to their stories. Once we engage in this practice, our mission statements begin to pale in comparison to the hopes, dreams and desires of those we long to reach. Instead, we&#x2019;ll find the opportunity to create manifestos&#x2014;collaborative invitations to belong and believe.&#x201D;</em><strong>Showing is more powerful than telling.<br></strong><em>&#x201C;Show &#x2018;the weird&#x2019; with the world. The greatest movements accomplish this through well-designed manifestos and stories (e.g., &#x2018;I Have a Dream&#x2019;). These movements learn how to take their weirdness and translate it in a way that makes sense to others and invites them to be a part of it.&#x201D;</em><strong>Embrace your spots.<br></strong><em>&#x201C;Be who you were before the world told you not to. Every movement begins with an invitation to embrace something different&#x2014;a unique point of view that stands in direct contrast to a bunch of other similar ones. On the one hand, this gives movements a unique advantage&#x2014;a distinct identity&#x2014;, on the other, it also gives them an undeniable vulnerability. Before movements are remembered for being extraordinary, they&#x2019;re questioned for being weird. You can take any movement and filter it through that two-part narrative: Christianity, Democracy, Women&#x2019;s Suffrage, Rock &#x2018;n&#x2019; Roll, The Civil Rights Movement, Punk, Disney, Apple, etc. Before any of them changed culture, they were met with varying amounts of skepticism and concern. This is because, while we&apos;re wired for &#x2018;weird,&#x2019; we feel safer with &#x2018;same.&#x2019;</em><em>&#xA0;</em><em>Weirdness is a muscle that needs to be flexed. After a movement has successfully hacked into the very culture that once doubted it, it&#x2019;s left with the often, scary task of taking a step back, looking inward and reimagining what&#x2019;s possible. For weirdos to keep their movement sustainable they must always find the courage to roll up their sleeves, erase the whiteboard and go back to the beginning&#x2014;away from the turning tides and trends that clamor for our attention.&#x201D; </em>No matter who you are, whether you&apos;re the CEO of a Fortune 100 or in the third grade, CJ&#x2019;s passionate about helping you discover and own your unique contribution to the world.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"<strong>What Are the Chances?</strong>Every year there&#x2019;s a miraculous journey of enormous risk. Salmon gamble everything to swim back to where they were born encountering extreme danger at each turn, leap and dash. It&#x2019;s a natural phenomenon on a global scale. If (a big if) they arrive then each fish spawns a bunch of new salmon (1,500&#x2013;1,0000 eggs). The portion who make it to back to the sea and eventual adulthood are a tiny fraction (0&#x2013;10). And so it is with innovation.<strong>Innovation. Really? </strong>In every business or institution on the planet, coming up with brilliant ideas, no matter how genius, is a lot easier than implementing them.We most likely have different ideas of what innovation means. But for the sake of my argument I&#x2019;m going to suggest it&#x2019;s an idea that improves on an existing one and that didn&#x2019;t exist before. Or it combines a whole set of existing ideas and makes things better in some way. For some, innovation simply means working differently. <strong><em>Innovation can be applied to anything. </em></strong>Genuine innovation in general is a highly contentious concept, and as we examine it further we can report the species as a highly endangered one.<strong>Innovation. If Only.</strong>Here&#x2019;s a scenario. You sit as the meeting unfolds. Your moment comes&#x2014;the chance to suggest that &#x2018;something&#x2019; burning in your heart&#x2014;your big idea for progress. You leap up. You&#x2019;ve witnessed the problem first hand. You know how much better things would be if only we changed the thing your way. You explain this new way. Your argument unfolds, it explains precisely how much better everything could be. You show what&#x2019;s not working. You prove how brilliantly what would. Your innovation. You sit down.Let&#x2019;s say there were fifteen people in that room. Seven of them were completely on board&#x2014;they got it&#x2014;straight out of the traps. Four more were positively engaged asking for a little more clarity on a few dimensions. Three were completely unconvinced and one didn&#x2019;t think there was a problem in the first place. The three who were unconvinced will shake the confidence of the four who asked for more clarity, and on a good day your idea is immediately 50:50.You could shift those numbers around any way you like and your big idea is still going to be the luckiest idea on the planet to make it into the world. The room empties. You&#x2019;re now on a roller coaster of emotions. You go from thrilled, to grilled, to suicide watch trying to grasp something close to another chance. You begin to realize that this isn&#x2019;t going to be a cake walk. A fishy business.<strong>What&#x2019;s It Gonna Take?</strong>On a slightly different tack it fascinates me how we assume that meetings are the place where creativity happens and the best decisions get made. Who believes that all the goodness, information and required appreciation can be squeezed into that tortured environment? A torture chamber for the creative.Those of us who get asked to come up with ideas often get asked to survive this test. The first major barrier to truly great ideas. We can see the crime scene clearly. We ram our thrashing, wriggling and youthfully inspiring idea into the crippling format of a slide deck. We plan our defense as much as possible&#x2014;we imagine the room full of disengaged people with little appreciation for the context nodding away. And we imagine that entirely arbitrary moment when the person in charge decides what&#x2019;s actually going to happen. Well alright it&#x2019;s not always like that but when was the last time a really great idea made it unscathed through a meeting?<strong>Innovation. Who Knew! </strong>These days we are so much better equipped to encourage ideas and have conversations across the organization. So how do we make that happen? We must make the discussion about ideas and progress the conversation, inviting as many people as possible to be involved. Leaders should try to make idea involvement a daily part of everyone&#x2019;s job. Because if it&#x2019;s encouraged people can be more creative, more imaginative and improve the ideas. We will and we do because it&#x2019;s human nature&#x2014;it&#x2019;s how we roll. We respond to the challenge and we spawn great ideas if we are in the right place and space.Innovation (especially the execution of it) isn&#x2019;t something that some &#x2018;body&#x2019; does&#x2014;it is a team sport. Ideas come from individuals, but get improved by other individuals. The hard part is making an idea stick and then executing on it. For that to happen we need to engage. We have to enable understanding and ownership. Because we don&#x2019;t like change&#x2014;and in some instances we actually fear it&#x2014;the only solution is to collaborate in whatever way we can so that as many people as possible are immersed in what it means and what it will take to make the idea a reality.&#xA0;<strong>Innovation. Get Lucky. </strong>Think of the challenges that a new idea faces as it swims to the sea. First of all, it&#x2019;s never been there before, everything is new and it needs to rely on its instincts. It looks around for the first signal of which way the water is flowing. Bang&#x2014;a rock.Nobody outside of its safe cocoon knows what to make of this strange fish. It needs to get dressed&#x2014;it has to look and sound like it knows why it&#x2019;s doing to everything and everybody along the way. The ravines and rapids of &#x2018;not invented here&#x2019; start crashing around its idea and the swirls and flurries are no place for faint hearted.<strong>Grizzly Bears.</strong>Whether swimming up or downstream innovation is an endangered species. It will eventually make it to the place where it will take really big leaps to get through. At this point, and without knowing until it flies out of the water, it will find itself under the deathly stare of &#x2018;they who&#x2019;ve been in the forests forever&#x2019;&#x2014;the big bears. Scary beasts with their own systems and processes who simply smack the unsuspecting idea straight out of the water without any care or trouble. Often just for the fun of it.? <em>If the idea makes it past here it&#x2019;s still nowhere near safe. </em>Out of the clear blue sky comes an aerial attack, one that can happen at any time but usually when the idea is taking a breather just a little too close to the surface of the water. If all this is overcome and the idea is freely swimming in the ocean going about its business, along comes the factory ship. The blunt nets of large enterprise pluck the now strong idea from its newly-found freedom in order to serve it up as just one more commoditized idea indistinguishable from countless others.<strong>The Metaphor Has Run Its Course. </strong>But you get the point.It&#x2019;s tough and most likely unfair but it&#x2019;s become a familiar circle of life. If you want innovation to survive you need to get after it with your eyes and ears open&#x2014;it requires nurture and protection by everyone.Perhaps the hardest part is the shift required in our habits and rituals&#x2014;the things we call mindset and behavior. There is an invisible frame that slowly fixates in our heads and informs how we do stuff every day. Anything that challenges our mental model is going to have to be one stealthy super-salmon to get past our fixed views.<em>&#x201C;The reasons we don&#x2019;t find solutions to our problems is because the answers to our questions interfere with our concepts.&#x201D; &#x2014;Anonymous </em>A fine and eloquent set of words that sum up why innovation is such a tough game. Innovation&#x2014;far more than a simple leap.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "principle":"THE WORLD&apos;S A STAGE, WHAT&apos;S YOUR STORY?",
       "content_body":"We recently reached out to <a href=\"https://chatbooks.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chatbooks</a> for an <a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/an-app-to-help-you-tell-your-photo-stories\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">interview focused on storytelling</a>, but talking deeper with their CMO, Rachel Hofstetter, we learned how amazing this brand really is. The values they operate by actively guide the way the company operates. Employees are actively and passionately engaged in the business, operating from a sense of confidence and empowerment. Their values-based culture results in high employee involvement, strong internal communication and a healthy level of risk-taking which encourages new levels of innovation. If there&#x2019;s any doubt about the value of investing time in culture, Chatbooks is an example of the significant benefits that come from a vibrant and alive culture.&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/1810674/culture-eats-strategy-for-lunch\">Culture, like brand, is misunderstood and often discounted</a> as a touchy-feely component of business that belongs to HR. It&#x2019;s not intangible or fluffy, it&#x2019;s not a vibe or the office d&#xE9;cor. It&#x2019;s one of the most important drivers that must be set, or adjusted, to attain long-term, sustainable success.<strong><em>A strong culture flourishes with a clear set of values and norms that actively guide the way a company operates.</em></strong>Chatbooks has five values from which they operate. These values are not only values that they hire and promote by, but values that they ensure every person on their team shares.By vetting operations around their values, Chatbooks creates an environment that sets-up their entire team for success. They are a stellar example of a living culture that drives people and performance.&#xA0;<strong><em>It&#x2019;s important to have diverse thinking and interests, but shared values and a common purpose are also a must to foster a cohesive community of people within the walls of an organization.</em></strong>I encourage you to step back and ask whether the purpose of your organization is clear and whether you have a compelling values system that is easy to understand. Mobilizing and energizing a culture is predicated on the organization clearly understanding the vision, mission, values, and goals and creating an environment for them to come alive.Chatbooks values support a number of internal and external programs. One example is their Momforce Model which is made up of over 60 men and women around the world working on their own hours at home&#x2014;and 60% of those hours are outside of the typical 8am-5pm work day.Another example is WFH Wednesdays. Expanding their mindset beyond 8-5, they offer all employees&#x2014;regardless of seniority&#xAD;&#x2014;the opportunity to work from home on Wednesdays to support parents and allow their people to explore. They also believe in breaking barriers and supporting women in the workplace. Sixty percent of their leadership roles are filled by women. And, inspired by their strong belief in family, they also provide a 90-day fully paid leave.&#xA0;&#xA0;Chatbooks also has unique ways to celebrate what they do. They have a Slack channel that is dedicated to the amazing stories they hear every day. As Hofstetter pointed out, &#x201C;<em>It&#x2019;s our Why</em>&#x2014;<em>it reminds us all why we matter, why what we do matters.</em>&#x201D; Most companies that run at speed often forget to celebrate their victories, both big and small, and they rarely have time or the humility to acknowledge and learn from their failures. Celebrate your victories and failures in your own unique way, but share them and share them often.They also give abundantly. <em>&#x201C;Give like a friend, before you ever think about getting anything in return&#x201D;</em> is a mantra they follow. They don&#x2019;t target specific ROI&#x2019;s but rather look forward to giving. They ensure that employees genuinely care about the company&#x2019;s role in the world and are passionately engaged. There&#x2019;s always an opportunity to connect employees at a deeper level to warrant that the pursuit of the common good is driving common wealth.Building a strong culture takes hard work and true commitment, but provides a collaborative environment for a brand to thrive in. Your brand is the single most important asset to differentiate you consistently over time, and it needs to be nurtured, evolved and invigorated by the people entrusted to keep it true and alive. Without a functional and relevant culture, the money invested in research and development, product differentiation, marketing and human resources is never maximized and often wasted because it&#x2019;s not fueled by a sustaining and functional culture.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"As one year comes to an end, and a new one is about to begin, it really is a special time. The madness stops for a few days, the phones are quiet, emails stop and there is time to relax and reflect. In the always on, always connected world we live in, we rarely make the time to step back and celebrate what we&#x2019;ve accomplished, reflect on what we&#x2019;ve learned or make plans to change how we go about life. Daily habits and the rhythm of life take most of us captive, and we often end up doing what we&#x2019;ve always done, and each year starts to look very much like the last. And while the arrival of a new year prompts many of us to make simple resolutions, like giving up alcohol, joining a gym, or giving up carbs most of us don&#x2019;t use the start of each new year to reset how we live to ensure we get the absolute best out of the entire year ahead.Each of us has the ability to choose how we show up to life every day: sleeves rolled up or hands out. Go into the New Year living consciously and connected to the inner strength that can affect how you think about and act on each and every day. You can&#x2019;t control the White House, but you can control your own house so take personal control of how you approach your own life.As I go into 2013 I know I will face challenges, but I know they are to be overcome, not to overwhelm. And while I can&#x2019;t change the broader economy or government policy, I can take responsibility for my attitude and how I will make this the best year yet. We&#x2019;re on this planet for a short time and every day we&#x2019;re alive is a gift. We all need a kick in the pants reminder that we are fortunate to live, work and play in the United States of America. As I&#x2019;m thinking through and planning how to make 2013 my personal best year ever, I thought the following Uncommon Sense principles might help you as you plan your year ahead.<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/pedrosz/6039494214/\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3481\" title=\"Resolute_3\" src=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Resolute_3.jpg\" alt width=\"395\" height=\"263\"></a><strong>1. Grab the year by the ears</strong><br> Look back at 2012 and celebrate your successes and identify your failures. Map what you learned from both and think about what you want to change in the year ahead. Define what success looks like for 2013, setting audacious and achievable goals. Envision what you want the year to look like, literally. Write a list by month, write a year-end letter to yourself, build a dream board, but don&#x2019;t go into 2013 without knowing what you want success to look like. Map out how you&#x2019;ll get there and what resources you&#x2019;ll need.<strong>2. Values are valuables</strong><br> Revisit your values and what&#x2019;s important to you on a personal level. These foundational principles should guide decisions around how you live and work. List the principles that are central to who you are and guide how you think and behave. Put your values to work daily throughout the year ahead. If it feels like we&#x2019;re walking away from the founding values this country was successfully built on do what Gandhi advised and &#x201C;be the change you want to see in the world.&#x201D; Decide what you really care about and the role you can play in helping make a positive change in the world.<strong>3. Gratitude is the attitude</strong><br> It&#x2019;s a universal truth that grateful people are happy people. Start every day with gratitude and thanks for the chance to live your life in a country that promotes freedom and the opportunity to be your best. Say thank you often, and mean it.<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/tprzechlewski/3647302361/\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3479\" title=\"Resolute_2\" src=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Resolute_2.jpg\" alt width=\"395\" height=\"263\"></a><strong>4. Trash the small stuff</strong><br> Like most people, you probably waste too much time on the small, insignificant, time-sucking, going nowhere stuff. Make a list of the things you do that waste time every day and list what you&#x2019;re going to do to change your behavior.<strong>5. Don&#x2019;t make money your God</strong><br> The sage father of my first girlfriend gave me some very simple advice that is as relevant today as it was then. He said, &#x201C;Never make money your God.&#x201D; I&#x2019;ve been asked many times this year whether the purpose for a company is to make a profit, and my answer has been the same every time: &#x201C;Making a profit is the by-product of a clearly defined purpose.&#x201D; As individuals we know money creates choices but it doesn&#x2019;t answer our need for purpose. Make sure money is not the reason or rationale behind what you do.<strong>6. Everything you do matters</strong><br> You are the sum of all of your parts, relationships, and actions. The advent of social media has highlighted the age-old truth that every action you take, and every conversation you have, matters.<strong>7. Be yourself and be courageous</strong><br> You don&#x2019;t have to follow the crowd. Take courageous steps to define the brand of YOU in 2013, reminding yourself of who you are, what makes you tick and why you get out of bed every day. Don&#x2019;t feel compelled to follow the crowd. Be courageous and be proud of being yourself.<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/86755183@N04/8050702301/\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3484\" title=\"Resolute_4\" src=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Resolute_41.jpg\" alt width=\"395\" height=\"263\"></a><strong>8. Surround yourself with smarts</strong><br> Don&#x2019;t surround yourself with &#x201C;yes people&#x201D; and fans. Friends and mentors should help make you a better version of yourself. Make sure the people around you are smarter and different than you. Have people in your life who will call you out and hold you accountable.<strong>9. Time is like gold, so spend it wisely</strong><br> Time is the most valuable commodity we&#x2019;re given. The weeks and months fly by, so plan your time carefully and don&#x2019;t waste it. Spend it generously with people who matter. I get up every morning at 5:15am to surf. I do it every day, and it&#x2019;s my time to reflect, exercise and connect with nature. Design time into your day that is only for you, not for work or for anyone else. A time where you think about your life and the role you&#x2019;re playing in it&#x2014;and pursue something you love. It&#x2019;s the best gift you&#x2019;ll give yourself.<strong>10. Do something new for the first time</strong><br> Learn to butcher a hog, ride a horse, run a marathon, write code or play the guitar. There&#x2019;s nothing like the excitement and learning that comes from doing something completely new for the first time.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Questions have the power to shift perspectives and encourage innovation. Questions build the platform for learning and lay the foundation to collect and analyze information to identify patterns and insights. Questions can create a framework for developing concepts and bringing new ideas to life. Questions encourage change in process and procedures. And questions can help employees grow and understand how they can contribute to the overall success of a business. Business leaders have the responsibility to ask the right questions&#x2014;to create a working environment that encourages curiosity&#x2014;a place where people are free to question the status-quo and to experiment with new approaches.<a href=\"http://www.alisongopnik.com\">Alison Gopnik</a> once said, &quot;Children are the research and development division of the human species&quot;. The perspective in which children view the world is one we can learn from&#x2014;looking at everything as if they&#x2019;ve seen it for the first time. Children don&#x2019;t have biases&#x2014;everything is open to exploration. Asking provocative questions, they challenge the status quo with uncommon intensity and frequency, allowing teams and businesses the opportunity to reframe their challenges. Leaders have the unique opportunity to inspire childlike curiosity by asking questions that engage creative thinking. Encourage teams to ask open-ended questions such as <em>how, why </em>and<em> what </em>that lead to generating solutions. Leaders should create an environment that allows for questions to be asked and answered in an honest and open forum. Ensuring that team members know there is no right or wrong answer will help people shift their perspectives and challenge traditions.<span>During the next brainstorming session ask the following questions: </span><strong>What are we missing?</strong>By simply scoping the landscape for gaps and opportunities can help find ways to enhance a solution. Encourage teams think beyond typical research methods like questionnaires, interviews and surveys and get outside the office to explore. This is a valuable exercise to help uncover creative opportunities and show how a product or service might complement a user&#x2019;s behavior. There is a lot to learn from direct observation. Combine traditional research methods with curious feet on the ground.<strong>What are we really trying to do?</strong>Focusing directly on the problem ensures we&#x2019;re concentrating on the right solution. Time must be devoted to holistically understand the challenge at hand. Taking a step back to ask, &#x201C;What is it that we are really trying to do?&#x201D; will help reframe the challenge for direct success.<strong>What can we learn from exploring domains outside of our industry?</strong>Most organizations don&#x2019;t have a pool for generating new ideas. Their pool is made up of the usual suspects&#x2014;competitors and existing customers. Breakthroughs are usually found when solutions are borrowed from other domains and adapt to one&#x2019;s own. Generating new ideas is a key activity businesses must do consistently&#x2014;not just when the case for innovation is knocking at the door. Remember, solutions that are common in one domain may be groundbreaking in another. When presented with a challenge, knowing what to ask is the difference between doing more of the same and doing something extraordinary.Just like children are equipped with questions about what&#x2019;s happening around them, businesses on the path to transformation also equip themselves with an arsenal of questions they can use to take on challenges. Leaders that ask the right questions and encourage their employees to do the same stimulate creative thinking and drive innovation throughout the organization. Better questions lead to better answers. &#xA0;&#xA0;<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

Brands have meaning<br> </strong>Brand is not a logo or a tagline. It&#x2019;s a multidimensional platform that can be your greatest differentiator and competitive edge. It represents both a rational and emotional connection to your various stakeholders and the consumer who ultimately decides to engage with you.<strong>2. Brands age and mature<br> </strong>Like a fine wine, brands can improve and mature with age. And like a wine poorly cared for, brands can also age poorly. It&#x2019;s important to understand how to care for and nurture your brand.<strong>3. Brands have human characteristics<br> </strong>Brands can be smart, hip, trendy, informative, spunky, quirky, trustworthy, ambitious, sweet, humble, focused&#x2026; and the list goes on. Recognizing your brand&#x2019;s human side will help create a better connection with the people you&#x2019;re trying to reach.<strong>4. Design is at the center of your brand<br> </strong>Your brand&#x2019;s visual identity, and the design language that defines it, are worthwhile investments given the role design plays in most categories of business today.<strong>Every brand should have a story to tell<br> </strong>Developing and sharing a compelling brand narrative is like crafting and telling a great story. Consider the history of your brand, its personality and what makes it unique. Begin crafting your story by finding a consistent voice that&#x2019;s authentically connected to your brand&#x2019;s purpose.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Tis&#x2019; the season. With 2012 marking another year in the evolving global financial crisis, and with more discerning consumer spending, there&#x2019;s no better time to ditch the traditional habits of fast fashion and start taking a little more responsibility for our spending.Described in the dictionary as &#x201C;morally right/and or morally acceptable&#x201D;, the word <em>ethical</em> is one we should all be considering. As Dame Vivienne Westwood stated &#x201C;this is not charity, this is work&#x201D;&#x2014;something that should be completed in a morally correct working world. It&#x2019;s simple really. Ethical fashion is created to increase the well-being of people and communities through clothing. It aims to defend fair wages, ethical working conditions, employee rights, and it supports healthy livelihoods as well as recycling excess waste and energy.Perhaps it&#x2019;s time to branch out from the typical shopping mall heroes (goodbye Forever 21), and take a look at the new faces of environmentally forward fashion and let them into our closets.As glamorous as the fashion industry may appear, look behind the sequin booming catwalk shows and glossy pages of your favorite magazines and there are endless supply chains riddled with ethical problems and corrupted morals of responsibility all in the name of looking good. Let&#x2019;s think about this. Fast fashion is a lot like fast food. It doesn&#x2019;t always taste great to eat but in general: you buy it, feel good for a little while, then after a period of time the damage it causes begin to show.There&#x2019;s often a certain unappealing clich&#xE9; associated with sustainable fashion as many of us think about green tinged tie-dye and khaki hemp trousers&#x2014;certainly not a trend that suits everyone&#x2019;s taste. But there is hope because there&#x2019;s a growing community of creative people helping to redefine the green stereotype.With globally renowned &#x2018;People Tree&#x2019; being one of the pioneers in responsible <a href=\"http://supportfairtrade.com\">Fair Trade</a> fashion, and collaborating with current designers and personalities such as Orla Kiely and Emma Watson, it&#x2019;s clear this style has come a long way from its retro counterparts. Additionally, independent designers are stepping up to the plate, creating well-priced and cool, unique pieces. Until Alexa Chung recently tweeted about &#x2018;The Reformation&#x2019; I was ignorant of the up-to-date young and ethical clothing brands, to which Chung describes as &#x201C;sustainable fashion that doesn&#x2019;t suck&#x201D;. Founded by Yaya Yael Aflalo and Chi Bui, the pair created &#x201C;a chic, limited edition collection that repurposes vintage and surplus materials&#x201D; all locally found in the Big Apple.Fashion giants such as H&amp;M are also jumping in with &#x2018;Conscious Collection&#x2019; released earlier this year (spotted on stars such as Natalie Portman and Michelle Williams) and high-end luxury brands like Vivienne Westwood are collaborating with &#x2018;Ethical Fashion Africa&#x2019; (creating accessories from recycled materials handcrafted by women in extreme poverty to help learn skills and build a better future); both labels are aiming to support disadvantaged communities by using organic fabrics to create guilt-free indulgences.Embracing ethical responsibility doesn&#x2019;t stop at clothing. Brighton based &#x201C;Beyond Skin&#x201D; focuses on handmade and vegan footwear, created locally using supplies close to home&#x2014;showing how easy it is to put your best foot forward. Plus with websites like &#x201C;My Green Lipstick&#x201D; showcasing new and established ethical designers, it&#x2019;s not difficult to locate several ethical brands in one place.If you&#x2019;re adamant that these ethical styles simply aren&#x2019;t for you, then who can resist a spot of thrift shopping? Wherever you are out and about, you&#x2019;re probably not far from a charity or vintage shop&#x2014;absolute treasure troves for desirable, unique and varied pieces. Not only are you recycling (and possibly giving to a good cause) but you&#x2019;re getting your mitts on something nobody else has&#x2014;so what&#x2019;s to lose?I&#x2019;m a young fashion blogger, and there are few things I enjoy more than shopping, be it online or not. The satisfaction of finding a piece I love is second to none and I don&#x2019;t doubt that satisfaction could be doubled if I was doing something good with my frivolous purchases. So, when picking out tomorrow&#x2019;s outfit or deliberating that next throw-away cotton t-shirt have a think because you never know, maybe green could really be the new black.<strong>5 Uncommon Sense Tips for shopping with a conscience:</strong>1. Before you hit the check-out lines think carefully. Do you really need this article of clothing? Do you have similar pieces you could customize or reinvent in your wardrobe? If the answer is yes, put it back. Plus, if a dress costs less than $20 than in reality, it&#x2019;s probably not very well made.2. If you&#x2019;re going to shop, try to shop locally. Even by reducing your car usage you&#x2019;re being ethical in more ways than one.3. When possible explore local thrift or Goodwill stores, you&#x2019;ll be surprised at the vintage gems worth discovering. Additionally, if you&#x2019;re not buying secondhand purchase long lasting products or items that are fixable&#x2014;this means durable fabric, and nothing throw away.4. Look for fair trade items, and if possible look into the background of stores before shopping. After all if we&#x2019;re after more ethical supply chains we don&#x2019;t want to buy into the wrong ones.5. &#xA0;Just buy less. Simple.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "title":"An Interview with Rachel Goble of The SOLD Project",
       "date":"November 03, 2013",
       "principle":"BRANDS ARE LIKE PEOPLE AND PEOPLE ARE LIKE BRANDS",
       "content_body":"<em>We recently stumbled upon <a href=\"http://thesoldproject.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The SOLD Project</a> and were greatly inspired by the mission of the company, and wanted to know more. Rachel Goble is one of the co-founders of The SOLD Project, which aims to prevent child prostitution through education by providing scholarships and resources to children at risk in Thailand. Aware of the immense passion of this project, we wanted to learn and share Rachel&#x2019;s story.</em><strong>What influenced you to co-found The SOLD Project?</strong><br> When I heard about human trafficking, I had a similar reaction to what yours probably was: I was horrified, especially when I learned that children were involved. This sparked my passion to understand this issue and contribute in whatever ways I could. My journey started with volunteering in Los Angeles, and shortly thereafter traveling to India to research and understand what was happening on a deeper level.While traveling in India, there was one story that really moved me. During my volunteerism with <a href=\"http://oasisint.net\">Oasis International</a>, we went on outreach to a local brothel in Mumbai. We walked up sets of stairs to a narrow hallway lined with rooms. Each of these rooms contained a waiting area, which housed multiple doors that opened to bedrooms. This was where the women slept, as well as where they took customers. I met with a couple of the women in one of the waiting areas and it was in this context that she shared her feelings of helplessness; that she was stuck. There were no bars, no chains&#x2014;nothing like we see in the drama-filled movies. But there were bars and chains in her mind that kept her there, unable to leave and start anew. I realized then that prevention was my calling, so that no person should ever get to a place in their life where they&#x2019;ve lost hope and feel as stuck as this woman did. From then on, my focus was on understanding how to help stop it before it began.<strong>Child exploitation is a tough subject to talk about. Where and how do you start?</strong><br> I think it totally depends on who you&#x2019;re talking <em>to</em>. Some people are really uncomfortable with this harsh reality and want nothing to do with it, while others are already educated on the topic and want to know more. I gauge what I share accordingly.<strong>What would you say to other young documentary enthusiasts and social-venture entrepreneurs to encourage them to pursue their passions?</strong><br> I would tell them that the power of a story is something that can break a lot of boundaries. Recognizing the influence that you can have on changing both culture and perceptions through film is something to take very seriously. If you&#x2019;re passionate about a topic and you feel that film is the most effective media to bring awareness to that topic, then the first thing you must do is to understand what your core values are in the storytelling process and to hold on to them and not let go. When working with a team, it&#x2019;s easy to get sidetracked with others&#x2019; opinions because there is no right or wrong&#x2014;especially when pursuing the creative track. For this reason, knowing what your non-negotiables are in your values is very important. I believe that any time we are operating with the skills we&#x2019;ve been blessed with, good things will happen.<strong>What&#x2019;s the best advice you&#x2019;ve ever been given?</strong><br> The best advice I have ever been given is to be rooted in love, and to act out of that place. When you&#x2019;re living out of a place where you&#x2019;re rooted in love, your work and relationships are stronger, and your ability to roll with the failures and successes becomes a journey in life rather than just the black and white of success or failure.&#xA0;The other part to that is getting to know yourself and being okay with who you are as a person. Because we live in a world where we are constantly trying to conform, I have found that I, my work, and my relationships are more authentic, and therefore stronger as a whole, when I know who I am. And, I know who I am best when I am rooted in love.<strong>Can you tell us what values you operate by as a company?</strong><strong>Where do you turn for inspiration?</strong><br> Many different places: my friends first and foremost; surrounding myself with crazy people who have big visions and big ideas and don&#x2019;t know what it means to be boxed in or limited is extremely inspirational to me. I&#x2019;m also a sucker for inspirational quotes like this one by Ernest Hemingway: &#x201C;Live the full life of the mind, exhilarated by new ideas, intoxicated by the romance of the unusual.&#x201D;<strong>What reactions has The SOLD Project received from communities?</strong><br> The SOLD Project works in a small community in Northern Thailand just outside of Chiang Rai, Thailand. When we first began five years ago, we started with giving a scholarship to a single girl named Cat&#x2014;her story inspired us to recognize the hope and possibility of a program focused on prevention. The community had, up until this point, been exposed to a handful of NGOs that had come through and caused more harm than good, so we knew as an organization that trust would take time to build. Because our Thailand director is from the community that we work in, there was instantly a natural connection to the work and services that we were interested in providing based on the needs that we saw. Now, five years later, the community has not only embraced our work but has taken ownership of maintaining the facilities. The parents of our students view our staff as leaders and mentors to their children and often come to us for advice. Overall, the relationship between the Freedom Resource Center and the community has become a cohesive unit. The biggest lesson that we have learned, and I believe the community has as well, is that we <em>need each other.&#xA0;</em><strong>What is the most meaningful story you&#x2019;ve heard along the way?</strong><br> The most meaningful story I&#x2019;ve heard along the way is featured in&#xA0;the film that I&#x2019;m now working on, which comes out this month, so stay tuned&#x2026;&#xA0;The short story is that earlier this year we got to personally witness that prevention does in fact work, as featured in a predicament with one of our students getting&#xA0;solicited by a trafficker.<strong>What is the best thing about your career?</strong><br> Being able to do what I love, while knowing that it does greater good in the world. My favorite part of my job is being the bridge between the issue and people interested in learning about it. And I&#x2019;m able to practice what I love to do along the way, including filmmaking, storytelling, and leading trips. I also enjoy the community my job brings, because this is an issue that so many people can play a role in, and I find great joy in showing people how their skill sets can help to prevent and stop human trafficking. And sometimes I even like the accounting tasks.<strong>What is the hardest part about your career?</strong><br> One of the most challenging parts of my career is hearing stories about students we provided opportunities and resources for have made choices that we <em>know</em> will lead them down a bad path. It&#x2019;s similar to when a parent works so hard to teach their children good values that will lead them down a positive road and becomes heartbroken when they make decisions that take them elsewhere. You want the best for those you love, especially when you see their infinite potential, and it&#x2019;s heartbreaking when they choose otherwise.The harsh reality that as good as any non-profit, parent, or person is, you&#x2019;re still working with people and there is always an element of vulnerability and unpredictability.<strong>What is the most interesting thing about your career?</strong><br> Complete freedom to be creative! Take for instance our newest video, Travel With Us. When thinking about how to express the mission and the vision of what The SOLD Project stands for, there are so many ways in which that can be encompassed. This allows for our team to reflect internally about what is at the heart of prevention as well as what taps into the hearts of others to draw them into the cause.And it was so much fun to work on the Freedom photography series alongside the film as a creative way to raise funds for the work that I so strongly believe in. Opportunities like this never cease to present themselves as long as I&#x2019;m willing to open myself up to new ideas, and to keep dreaming and creating.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Brand is misunderstood, underappreciated and very often underutilized. When <em>brand</em> comes up in a meeting, it often means different things to different people, and many executives speak the language of brand the way some of us speak Spanish: with a limited vocabulary and rotten accent. And while being fluent in another language is helpful, not understanding the definition, and differentiating value and places to deploy it properly can be highly problematic. Despite the excellent books, many courses, and conferences dedicated to brand there&#x2019;s still confusion surrounding its meaning and how it should be operationalized even within the most sophisticated companies.At Bulldog Drummond, one of our key practices guides a wide range of organizations, from multi-billion dollar internationals to passionate startups and not-for-profits, to define and unlock the power of their brand (whether it&#x2019;s refreshing or repositioning tired brands or building new-to-world brands from scratch). We are most often hired by the executive team, venture firm or private equity group driving the business to help explore and define the brand&#x2019;s relevance and reason for being&#x2014;and we&#x2019;re often asked to explore the permission that brand has to stretch or expand.After working with so many leadership teams to develop and refresh brands, I&#x2019;ve come to the realization that brands are like people and people are like brands. They are complex, and like great people great brands are dimensional; they have a soul, personality and behaviors that differentiate them from others. They leave an impression and invite you to engage with them. Great brands are interesting and make it clear why people need them, and it&#x2019;s from this vantage point that I&#x2019;d like to offer a few key areas to help you think about the power of <em>brand</em>.<strong>Brand is the sum of many parts</strong><br> Why do so many executives who talk about brand not understand its full potential as a business asset? Many see it from a single tactical dimension instead of its entirety. Many mistakenly see brand as the logo, an ad campaign or what&#x2019;s on product packaging. They don&#x2019;t understand the strategic power that a fully articulated brand platform holds when deployed across all areas of the business.Take a minute to think about a friend who stands out from the crowd, who has made an impression on others. Now think about why they&#x2019;re memorable? The impression we create when we meet other people is formed by the way we behave, the way we look and dress, the way we communicate and the value we deliver. In the same way we form opinions about people, we form opinions about brands. Brand is the impression we have of a product or a service and is based on the sum of our experiences and interactions with it. Everything a brand does matters.<strong>Brand is rational and emotional</strong><br> Like people, brands have two sides: the rational and the emotional. Both sides need to be clearly defined and deployed for a brand to unlock its full potential. Think of a brand like a person living with purpose, adding value to people&#x2019;s lives and operating with a set of guiding principles. Start with being clear why your brand exists and what it&#x2019;s trying to accomplish and then think about how it should behave to ensure it&#x2019;s relevant and memorable. The rational side is built on the passion to solve a problem or meet an unmet or unrealized need, and this informs and fuels the brand&#x2019;s purpose or reason for being. Just like a person who operates with integrity, a brand should have a clearly defined set of principles or values that guide how it behaves. The principles form the rational building blocks for the brand, and combined with a clear mission (what you intend to do to achieve your purpose) and a clear strategy (the immediate actions you will take to deliver on your mission) a working platform is formed to guide the brand&#x2019;s actions so they are relevant, coordinated and consistent.The brand strategy should guide and inform the brand&#x2019;s personality and behavior, working together to inform the emotional connections it makes with the people it serves. The strategy should inform everything the brand does, the actions it takes, the places it appears and how it engages, educates and entertains. The emotional side of the brand is brought to life by all forms of memorable and relevant brand expression across internal (company culture) and external (consumer-facing) touchpoints. These touchpoints include the experience design of the product or service, visual, written and dimensional communication, advertising, outreach, customer service and the overall experience before, during and after purchase.<strong>Brand differentiates</strong><br> Just like memorable people, brands that stand out from the crowd do so because they intrigue people, are memorable and different. Compelling brands are relevant, engaging, entertaining and more often than not, courageous. They take a stand for or against something and have the confidence to stand apart from the crowd. People remember compelling brands and know what to expect from them.Your brand is one of the most important assets you possess to drive and differentiate your business&#x2014;if your brand is not clearly defined, understood and embraced by the entire organization it will never realize its full potential to impact your business. It&#x2019;s important to ensure that there is understanding and clarity around what <em>brand</em> means in business terms and what it can do to drive innovation, communication and differentiation. And then it is imperative to have complete alignment on your brand platform with your entire executive team. Your brand is one of the most powerful drivers for engagement and performance across all areas of your business.<strong>Brand does not belong to marketing</strong><br> Every CEO must be the leading brand ambassador and ensure every department head understands how to bring the brand to life at their level of the company. Because finance experts or lawyers lead many corporations, they often rely on the CMO to own and champion the brand. But just as culture isn&#x2019;t the sole responsibility of HR, brand is not the sole responsibility of marketing. While the execution of many dimensions of brand, specifically expression and communication, traditionally sit with marketing the entire executive team has the responsibility to ensure they understand and champion the brand through their words, actions, and behaviors&#x2014;and bring it to life through their function of the business. Every department in the company has a role to play in bringing the brand to life and to ensure it is alive, vibrant, and maximized.<strong>Brand needs love and attention</strong><br> Just like people, brands need to be carefully nurtured and managed, and like people, they get old and tired and need reinvigorating. Every CMO should perform a regular health check on their brand. I don&#x2019;t mean looking at brand awareness research, but fully understanding the health of your brand internally. Do regular refresher sessions on brand for all key leaders. Starbucks just spent $35 million to make sure their staffers are passionately connected and understand who they are and where they are going as an organization.<strong>Brand clarity drives confidence and performance</strong><br> We&#x2019;ve spent the past eighteen months working with the CEO and executive team of a national brand that needed to redefine its reason for being and its place in the world. The business was in significant danger with sales down by 8% year-over-year, stock prices at a 52-week low, employees operating with an unclear business strategy, and a languishing culture. One of the most significant issues holding the company back was the lack of alignment around brand and what it meant to the business.After working collaboratively with the executive team to develop a new brand platform and mobilize their organization of 60,000 people around it, same store sales increased by 11%, their stock price hit a 52-week high and their employee engagement significantly increased. This turnaround took courage, commitment and patience to drive change, and the single most important catalyst was brand clarity. Like confident people, brands that operate with clarity generally deliver more consistent results.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span><em>Photo: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/31246066@N04/6592174435/sizes/m/in/photostream/\" target=\"_blank\">Ian Sane</a></em>"

       "content_body":"By now it&#x2019;s clear that social networking &#x201C;platforms&#x201D; like Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest are stable environments where the people of the world spend a great deal of their free time. I&#x2019;m not predicting that any one of these will last forever, but I am pretty confident that all signs point towards people spending more time in these types of interactions, taking away from traditional forms of media like print and television. The allure of reaching millions of people with personalized messages is causing brands to take notice and <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2013/05/08/pinterest-most-popular-brand-boards/%29\" target=\"_blank\">experiment with new ways</a> to reach their customers. I&#x2019;m hopeful that advertising innovation is added to the long list of disruptions created by the Internet, but for the most part I think brands are still struggling with this new opportunity. It&#x2019;s easy to &#x201C;go digital&#x201D; when they can repurpose existing advertising campaigns from print or television, but when they try to get personal and invent new relationships in the social space, their efforts are often uninspiring.According to Royal Pingdom, corporate brands are <a href=\"http://royal.pingdom.com/2012/07/30/top-brands-surprisingly-weak-on-facebook-and-twitter/%29\" target=\"_blank\">far less successful</a> than popular personalities on Facebook and Twitter as measured by number of followers and interactions. In his post <a href=\"http://www.psfk.com/2013/04/brand-messaging.html\" target=\"_blank\">Why brands are not your friends</a>, social communications consultant Tom Evans says, &#x201C;A brand&#x2019;s social media presence exists to serve the consumer, not act as a faux BFF.&#x201D; So true.Savvy brands don&#x2019;t pretend to be your friend or trick you into buying something. There are many great examples of brands that use social media as an opportunity to connect their real employees with their real customers. Ford and McDonald&#x2019;s, for example, list the names and photos of the employees who manage their Twitter pages to avoid displaying an impersonal corporate voice or any pretense corporate friendship. You know exactly who originates their posts.The problem here is not solely with the brand and their lack of imagination or awkward implementation. There is also a platform design problem in the mix. Facebook was not designed with brands in mind or they wouldn&#x2019;t call all relationships &#x201C;friends.&#x201D; Real people have many types of association with others and don&#x2019;t live in a faux world where everyone is their friend. Facebook is designed with a fundamental flaw with this insistence built into their platform. Furthermore, Facebook has a consistent track record of <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-57558638-83/facebook-voting-is-gone-but-privacy-issues-just-get-worse/\" target=\"_blank\">wielding their power over users&#x2019; best interests</a><span>.</span> As a free service, I give them full support to push the world forward in service of their own mission, but this doesn&#x2019;t necessarily build trust or encourage real friendship, causing everyone to be less friendly to each other and more so to brands that try to blend into their news feeds. It&#x2019;s like being at a party and having someone you don&#x2019;t know step into a circle of three intimate friends discussing someone&#x2019;s recent indiscretion. The conversation suddenly stalls and becomes awkward. The only recovery is to excuse yourself to get a refill on your drink or bring up a neutral topic, &#x201C;So how about the weather today, huh?&#x201D;Give Facebook full credit for building the world&#x2019;s largest social network but don&#x2019;t assume they have your best interests in mind while interacting on the site. And that lack of trustworthiness makes it very difficult to get truly personal. People tend to withhold personal information if they perceive risk. One glance at my news feed and I find several unwelcomed examples of ads for products and services that I don&#x2019;t want, never wanted, and find annoying. I realize that selling space within my personal conversations so I can use the app for free is consistent with the age-old argument for cramming dozens of commercials into primetime television. If you want to consume premium content someone has to pay for it right? So it&#x2019;s easy for the brands to justify this, but reminds us that most are tone deaf to user-centered design and really don&#x2019;t care about us as people&#x2014;they just want to push their product.I whole heartedly agree that makers of premium content should charge full price, but the traditional forced-ads approach is poorly designed, poorly executed and, in a world of many choices, will lead people <em>away</em> from brands&#x2019; efforts. A heavy, inappropriate ad load is simply too annoying and impersonal to keep users engaged when they can switch to other forms of connection and entertainment.But back to the brand side of things&#x2026; the challenge for brands remains: <em>how to leverage the compelling power of social media</em>? Can they unlock the promise of personalization to connect better with customers? I&#x2019;d say yes, but only if they start with users in mind. You can get personal, but you have to get out of the way.The basic design flaw inherent in Facebook gave rise to &#x201C;pages&#x201D; that allowed brands to set up a presence within the app. But apparently this wasn&#x2019;t generating enough revenue, probably because being in a margin away from the main traffic is like putting your new store off in a field instead of the center of town. Conventional wisdom states: location, location, location! Or you could just realize that in a virtual world, in order to drive traffic you need to offer something really interesting&#x2014;content is king!Some brands have developed clear, interesting voices and offer valuable content that attracts people to their pages. But for many companies this is a difficult challenge, and they use social media in awkward, forced product pushes that are simply digital versions of the junk mail we used to see in our snail-mail boxes. The lack of imagination and tact these brands employ in their campaigns can be too blatant and stunningly out of touch.Nobody wants to sign up or follow these brands because they are simply spamming people with crap. To all of this I say, <em>caveat emptor </em>(buyer beware), and remember lesson number one to kids on safe use of social media, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t accept invitations from people you don&#x2019;t know.&#x201D;To get more content in users streams, savvy brands simply become reporters on the latest happenings in and around their brand. Instead of pretending to be a &#x201C;friend&#x201D; the employees who work at the brand use the pronoun &#x201C;we&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;me&#x201D; to speak on behalf of the company, providing updates on new happenings and interesting sidebars on things their customers care about.To pull this off successfully, a brand has to be crystal clear (and committed) to who they are and what they value. A brand should not exist to push a product. It should exist to clarify potential<a href=\"http://www.brandchannel.com/home/post/2013/05/15/Oreo-Wonderfilled-051513.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">&#xA0;like Oreo</a>, stand for something like <a href=\"http://methodhome.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Method Home</a>, or make a difference in people&#x2019;s lives like <a href=\"http://www.dezeen.com/2013/06/12/ads-with-a-new-purpose-by-ogilvy-mather-for-ibm/\">IBM</a>. When a brand is successful at presenting itself as a distinct <em>way of being</em>, customers will flock to it. Brands that earn the right to get personal do not trick their customers into buying something any more than strangers become friends by providing shallow offers for free drinks if you promise to go home with them. You can&#x2019;t buy friendship, but you can inspire others to like you by standing for something real and being yourself.Brands can only get personal on social networks when they demonstrate their beliefs about goodness in the world and then live up to them with their content. Nike take note&#x2014;if you want customers to behave like high performance athletes, your Nike Plus website better load quickly and deliver the goods according to your world-class standards. I won&#x2019;t post my runs if it takes longer to access the website than it did to run my 5K workout.And for all other brands, step up and be unique, then deliver with passion and excellence. Offer something in your posts that no one else can touch. I might be your friend if you stop pushing yourself on me. And who knows, if we&#x2019;re friends I might even be more likely to buy your stuff when I need it.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

Without courage we go nowhere.As a transformational force, courage contains three uncommon sense ingredients:Whether you&#x2019;re a CEO, an executive, a manager or a student, you need to have the courage to make tough decisions about what next. The following are six uncommon sense recommendations for making courageous choices&#xA0;for new thinking:<strong>1. HAVE THE&#xA0;COURAGE TO ASK WHY</strong>Spend any time around a five year-old, and you&#x2019;ll hear them ask &#x201C;Why?&#x201D; constantly. Their lack of self-awareness enables them to absorb information and seek knowledge constantly. As we grow up and enter the workplace, lacking knowledge is, for many, a sign of weakness. The result is people often sit in meetings and, rather than admit they don&#x2019;t understand the subject, they&#x2019;ll fake it, and waste a perfect opportunity for learning.&#xA0;There&#x2019;s something very liberating about admitting you&#x2019;re the dumbest one in the room and acting like a sponge.Do you:<strong>2. HAVE THE COURAGE TO STAND OUT</strong>It sounds like such obvious advice, but stand back and ask yourself if you honestly stand apart from the competition. Think about American Airlines, Delta, United and Continental&#x2014;cover up the logos and you get the same absolutely average experience with nearly no differentiation. But imagine the difference it would make if American Airlines started translating what being American means into the customer experience or imagine if United started actually uniting in meaningful ways with its passengers.Do you:<strong>3. HAVE THE COURAGE TO STAND FOR SOMETHING</strong>People are inherently good and, deep down, they want to make a difference in the world. That&#x2019;s one of the reasons consumers are relating so strongly to brands that stand for something greater than the product itself. Look at the meteoric rise and brilliance of Apple in all of its beautiful forms. It has revolutionized how we think about computing, music, and phones among other things. Apple is a brand with a fanatical following and has significant opportunity to affect change on any issue it chooses to engage in. But what have they done with this permission to stand for something significant? Arguably this hasn&#x2019;t impacted their balance sheet or the ravenous demand for their products, but imagine what difference they could make if they stood for something?Do you:<strong>4. HAVE THE COURAGE TO SAY NO&#xA0;</strong>Companies and individuals are generally people pleasers, with the compulsion to say yes. Peer pressure, fads and demand often force decisions that create a lack of conviction, complication and confusion. As the US economy took a tumble, luxury automotive manufacturers could have opted to create more economical models that suited to the demand of what the masses could afford. Instead, the likes of Bentley and Ferrari stuck to their guns, weathered the storm and remained true to who they are and the consumers they cater to.Do you:<strong>5. HAVE THE COURAGE TO CHANGE</strong>It takes a large bucket of courage to admit you&#x2019;re going down the wrong path and then to change direction, especially when the entire category and the rest of the business world has their eyes on you. In 2009, Starbucks hit one of the most challenging times in their history because they had expanded rapidly and, in some places, over-saturated the market. They lost focus on the core coffee experience by adding too many unrelated items and the obvious onslaught of the economic downturn affected them as well. Howard Shutlz had the courage to return and immediately work to fix, simplify and change the direction of the business. He took it back to the brilliant basics and looked hard at what the business needed to change. Bulldog Drummond had the privilege of designing and facilitating an executive &#x201C;What Next?&#x201D; summit to help guide a conversation to chart the future of the brand. Mr. Schultz had courage to change paths and the results now speak for themselves.Do you:Back to Winston Churchill&#x2019;s eloquent view that if courage is the first of human, and therefore corporate, qualities (as it guarantees the success of all others), now&#x2019;s a good time to evaluate how courageous you are. Measure whether you&#x2019;re brave, persistent and honest, and then do the same with your department and the company you&#x2019;re a part of.Can you be more courageous?<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

Mr. Schultz had courage to change paths and the results now speak for themselves.Do you:Have the courage to take responsibility for mistakes made under your leadership?<br>Have the courage to change direction when it&#x2019;s not working?<br>Have the courage to kill products that don&#x2019;t fit but are making money?<br>Have the courage to ask for help?&#xA0;Back to Winston Churchill&#x2019;s eloquent view that if courage is the first of human, and therefore corporate, qualities (as it guarantees the success of all others), now&#x2019;s a good time to evaluate how courageous you are. Measure whether you&#x2019;re brave, persistent and honest, and then do the same with your department and the company you&#x2019;re a part of.&#xA0;<a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/author/shawn-parr#filters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Read more by Shawn Parr.</em></a><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"We believe in embracing who you are and what you believe fully&#x2014;even if that part of you is a little weird. <a href=\"ttps://www.cjcas.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CJ Casciotta</a> does too. CJ&#x2019;s a brand enthusiast, a dad and the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Get-Weird-Discover-Surprising-Difference/dp/154603191X\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Get Weird: </em><em>Discover the Surprising Secret to Making a Difference</em></a>. CJ has helped a number of brands embrace their Uncommon and reap the benefits.CJ shared with us a number of Uncommon Principles that he follows to help brands <a href=\"https://www.cjcas.com/about/\">Get Weird</a> and gave us a look at the 4-step process he adheres to that make those principles successful.&#xA0;<strong><em>&#x201C;Every </em></strong><strong><em>movement begins with an invitation to embrace something different&#x2014;a unique point of view that stands in direct contrast to a bunch of other similar ones. On the one hand, this gives movements a unique advantage&#x2014;a distinct identity&#x2014;, on the other, it also gives them an undeniable vulnerability.&#x201D; <br></em></strong>Before movements are remembered for being extraordinary, they&#x2019;re questioned for being weird. You can take any movement and filter it through that two-part narrative: Christianity, Democracy, Women&#x2019;s Suffrage, Rock &#x2018;n&#x2019; Roll, The Civil Rights Movement, Punk, Disney, Apple&#x2014;the list goes on. Before any of them changed <em>culture,</em> they were met with varying amounts of skepticism and concern. This is because, while we&apos;re wired for &#x2018;<em>weird&#x2019;,</em> we feel safer with &#x2018;<em>same&#x2019;</em>.<strong><em>&#x201C;As we get older, that notion seems to inevitably leak into our companies, our teams and what we communicate to our audience. It&#x2019;s much easier to model what seems to be working for others instead of doing the hard work of finding (and owning) what we uniquely have to say.&#x201D; <br></em></strong>Apple never epitomized another computer company and Charity: Water never sought to resemble another non-profit. What made these movements so groundbreaking (and ultimately effective) was that they knew what problem they wanted to solve, discovered what the market was missing, and owned what made them uncommon amidst a sea of similar thinking.<strong><em>&#x201C;The act of articulating exactly why that unique thing we offer the world is different and therefore valuable to others becomes necessary if we want to build a movement, something meaningful that gathers others, grows, and eventually creates long-term cultural change.&#x201D;<br></em></strong>While getting your culture right might seem like a victory and as CJ points out, &#x201C;<em>in many ways it is,&#x201D; </em>&#xA0;it should never be viewed as a finish line. Your culture is always a work in progress. Once a culture becomes normal, stagnancy sets in and irrelevance inevitably follows. In order to keep growing, a movement must begin to find what&#x2019;s weird again. That&#x2019;s most obviously true for a non-profit, enterprise or political office, but it&#x2019;s equally true for a friendship, marriage or family. Regardless of what context we find ourselves in, if we bank on things to constantly stay the same, we&#x2019;ll be disappointed at one of two inevitable outcomes&#x2014;either they will (or we will) become bored, ineffectual and distant, or they won&#x2019;t and we&#x2019;ll be confused, disappointed and unprepared.&#xA0;<strong><em>&#x201C;Weirdness is a muscle that needs to be flexed.&#x201D;<br></em></strong>After a movement has successfully hacked into the very culture that once doubted it, it&#x2019;s left with the often, scary task of taking a step back, looking inward and reimagining what&#x2019;s possible. For weirdos to keep their movement sustainable they must always find the courage to roll up their sleeves, erase the whiteboard and go back to the beginning&#x2014;away from the turning tides and trends that clamor for our attention.<strong>The 4-step process CJ follows to help people and brands get weird:</strong>The late Italian semiotician, Umberto Eco, proposed that every cultural phenomenon could be studied as communication. Throughout history, virtually every movement has followed a basic method for effectively getting its message out to those they seek to reach.CJ&#x2019;s weird-thinking approach helps movements (1) harness what makes them weird and (2) gather people around them by (3) creating a manifesto that (4) leads to cultural change.At some point, every last one of us needs to <a href=\"https://www.getweirdbook.com/home?r_done=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get Weird</a>.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"One hundred years ago this year, <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/637641/Thomas-J-Watson-Sr\">Thomas J. Watson Sr.</a> took over the <a href=\"http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/logo/logo_4.html\">C-T-R Company</a>. It was a haphazard consolidation of mismanaged companies&#x2014;producers of meat and cheese slicers, coffee grinders, candy scales, time clocks and tabulating machines. It was deep in debt and on the verge of bankruptcy. From this institution he created the <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/us/en/\">IBM Corporation</a>. Watson Sr., considered IBM&#x2019;s traditional founder, dedicated the last four decades of his life to his company. It became one of the world&#x2019;s greatest corporate innovators.Watson Sr.&#x2019;s path was not an easy one though. He immediately faced five back-to-back recessions followed by the Great Depression. Then, rather than receiving a pat on the back for surviving, the economy treated him to four more economic downturns. All of this was punctuated with four of the six steepest stock market declines in recorded history. Remarkably during this economic turmoil, he transitioned his company from hand-cranked mechanical devices sitting on his customers&#x2019; front and back counters to electrically-powered tabulating machines, sorters, printers and typewriters filling their back offices.Watson Sr. built a strong corporate culture upon employee dedication and loyalty. He used maxims&#x2014;simple, memorable guides to life&#x2014;to establish a business family instead of a family business. Three of these maxims were generously applied in his speeches of the day: Democracy in Business, We Are All Assistants, and We Forgive Thoughtful Mistakes. Watson Jr. would later distill his father&#x2019;s many maxims into three simple words that became IBM&#x2019;s Basic Beliefs&#x2014;its 20<sup>th</sup> Century corporate constitution. Is it too hard to imagine that the belief system that gave rise to the prior century&#x2019;s greatest corporate culture could serve as a starting point for similar journeys in this century?<strong>Watson Sr.&#x2019;s Democracy in Business</strong>Watson Sr. took personal responsibility for the tenor of his corporation. He&#xA0; encouraged employees to speak their minds and bring their problems and solutions forward without fear. But he told them, &#x201C;any policy in our business that is not good for every man is not a good policy for business, and we will not adopt it.&#x201D;He made sure that each employee understood his democracy in business: it had nothing to do with how heartily they sang from the IBM song book, but rather how much they believed in their hearts that they could pull together as one man. He told them that if they wouldn&#x2019;t associate with a fellow employee because they thought they were of a better class, higher social standing or educational stature, there was no place for them in his organization. He was looking for employees that would be willing to spend all day helping a coworker&#x2014;not because they had to, but because they wanted to&#x2014;even though it might mean doing their own work at night.Watson Sr. with his concept of democracy in business was creating the first corporate employee-owners&#x2014;men and women that would make business decisions as if they carried the owner&#x2019;s burden. These employee-owners would eventually call themselves IBMers. The term did not acknowledge a person&#x2019;s social class, educational background, pay grade, time-in-service, stock ownership, or corporate stature; rather it described a person of commitment, dedication and loyalty. It was an individual in a win-win relationship with their company and part of a corporate family. Of course there were leaders&#x2014;in a Watson Sr. democracy someone had to be held accountable for a final decision&#x2014;but IBMers discussed issues as peers, united around achieving a common goal.<strong>Watson Sr. Fostered an Environment of Innovation</strong>In the midst of the depression, Tom Watson Sr. desired an organization that encouraged individual thought and emboldened individual action. He needed his employee-owners to take risks. He told members of the IBM Club, &#x201C;There is not a man in this room who needs to ask his supervisor whether he should do this or that. . . . Use your own initiative. . . . Do not wait for your supervisor to tell you to do something. . . . That is the only way a man will ever gain promotion in this business.&#x201D; Watson Sr., so commonly associated with the word THINK, was also known by his employee-owners for another word he almost always used in the same breath&#x2014;ACT.He knew that with forward movement came mistakes. Mistakes are the great instructors of the lowly and the mighty, and the Recession of 1921 exposed one of Watson&#x2019;s mistakes. He forecast a year of 100 percent growth and it did not happen. According to Thomas and Marva Belden in <em>The Lengthening Shadow</em>, &#x201C;Salaries were cut 10 per cent. . . men were laid off, skilled and expensive labor going first. Watson made the mistaken decision to stop producing new printers. . . . Watson had strained his credit to the limit.&#x201D; Even with the economic backdrop of the Roaring Twenties, it would take eight years to recover the revenue he lost in one.So in 1932 Watson stood before the best-of-his-best salesman and admitted his mistake. &#x201C;I am ashamed,&#x201D; he told them. &#x201C;We just didn&#x2019;t hang on to our courage and our belief in IBM and in IBM men.&#x201D; He modeled what he believed&#x2014;thoughtful mistakes would be forgiven, just keep moving forward.<strong>Watson Jr.&#x2019;s Summative Words: Respect, Service and Excellence</strong>IBM&#x2019;s founder had discovered the best path for growth through the twentieth century. Unfortunately, by the 1940s, all the needs of his corporation could no longer fit through his always open, but lone door&#x2014;now the person that most inhibited his company&#x2019;s growth was the old man himself.Thomas J. Watson Jr. inherited a company that was now famous for high pay, generous benefits and intense devotion &#x201C;to Dad.&#x201D; So Watson Jr., upon assuming control, shifted this loyalty&#x2014;not to himself, but to the corporation. He moved away from his father&#x2019;s authoritarian structure. He re-architected IBM.He built a unique set of corporate touchstones for evaluating, thinking and acting independently. These beliefs embodied the same set of principles as his father but the new approach was scalable. Using three basic beliefs as a corporate constitution, he monitored and controlled their execution across the corporation. He implemented multiple channels of communication: information flowed up from the employee-owners through Opinion Surveys, Feedback Sessions, Executive Interviews and Speak Ups; information flowed down through Management Briefings and Executive Letters. This constant flow of guiding information under the CEO&#x2019;s watchful eye, prevented departmental dictatorships, controlled anarchy, ensured corporate consistency, and illuminated and eliminated elephants in any room where critical decisions were being made.This constitution was based on:Decentralizing under the control of these beliefs reignited IBM&#x2019;s growth. Watson Jr.&#x2019;s organization grew sales 34.8% the first year and between 12.6% and 21.2% each of the four years after that. And it was the management framework that delivered the System/360&#x2014;today&#x2019;s mainframe computer.<strong>Imagine If</strong>&#x201C;Everything that is new is usually nothing but the promising child of time-tested older achievements&#x2014;an ideal continuation of tradition.&#x201D;- Elisabeth G&#xFC;rtlerChange is inevitable. While learning from the past we should not be held hostage to it.

However, almost every one of them lacks the appropriate amount of time to develop and mold these ideas. Not everyone is dealing with a burning platform, but getting teams to spend quality time together on significant issues seems to be a challenge for most. However, when the time is deligated, significant&#xA0;problems are&#xA0;solved and value is created. Unfortunately, most companies do not create the space to do so until it&#x2019;s almost too late.<strong>WHAT&#x2019;S YOUR PROBLEM?<br></strong>No matter what industry you&#x2019;re in, or what position you hold in your company, it&#x2019;s very likely that you are under a siege of challenges every day you step into the office. Whether it&#x2019;s not having enough time, the right resources, an exhausted team, an executive team that is out of touch with the realities of your day-to-day, or mixed messages, challenges can compound quickly. The good news is you&#x2019;re not alone. Most companies face this challenge daily, and while there&#x2019;s no comfort in that knowledge, the first step in solving your challenge is to acknowledge you have one, and then to define what the problem is so you can determine how to solve it.<strong>WHY DON&#x2019;T YOU SPEND MORE TIME WORKING TOGETHER?<br></strong>We often find that culture is in the way of the solution, that the right people (from the same company) are not in the same room together, and there is rarely enough time to focus on the issue at hand. If this sounds elementary and obvious, it is. It&#x2019;s a disease that is affecting corporate health every day. Look at your day today, your team, your priorities, and your schedule, and I&#x2019;d bet one of the biggest challenges you have is the lack of time you have to think about tomorrow. Everyone needs more time to think and when the time is allocated, when people work together to think about tomorrow and strive to solve big challenges, amazing things will happen.<strong>STARBUCKS GOT LASER FOCUSED<br></strong>We were fortunate to work with the Starbucks executive team and a number of their trusted outside partners. Their incredible turnaround story is now a well-read case study that will inspire many innovative business leaders for years to come. From our vantage point, Starbucks was created the time and the space to understand their challenges and designed a process to focus on rebuilding their brand with an appropriate sense of urgency and focus. Along with the single-mindedness of a leader with a vision, they put the right people where they needed to be and allocated their resources appropriately to do the job properly.When we&#x2019;re framing a project to help a team solve a significant challenge or attack a big opportunity, we always take the following steps:<strong>STEP 1: &#xA0;WHAT&#x2019;S THE PROBLEM? FRAME THE CHALLENGE CLEARLY<br></strong>While it sounds obvious, framing the challenge clearly is the first step to take.&#xA0;Use the power of &#x201C;Why?&#x201D; to ensure the challenge is clearly stated and that everyone on your team understands the problem or the opportunity. Frame the challenge as a question. For example, when working with Mattel, we asked &#x201C;What does the future of toy shopping look like?&#x201D;<strong>STEP 2: UNLEASH CROSS-FUNCTIONAL TEAMS<br></strong>Brilliant minds inside companies are often under-utilized because there isn&#x2019;t a venue to bring them together. These minds don&#x2019;t get enough time with their peers and are rarely put into environments designed to produce them with enough time to attack a single issue. When solving a challenge, don&#x2019;t just have marketing or product development teams attack the problem. Instead, unleash the power of cross-functional teams and, if possible, more than one. Pick at least five people from different functions who have a perspective on the challenge you&#x2019;re trying to solve and utilize their brilliant minds to their maximum potential.<strong>STEP 3: PUT THE CONSUMER (AND KEY INSIGHTS) INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE CHALLENGE<br></strong>PowerPoints, charts, and graphs send the smartest people to sleep fast. Millions of dollars are flushed down the&#xA0;drain because people aren&#x2019;t paying attention to the data and the knowledge it contains is not organized in a manner that tells a compelling story.&#xA0;Bringing the consumer to life as people, not just as data, places the consumer and key scenarios into the middle of the&#xA0;challenge in an organized and insightful approach.<strong>STEP 4: DESIGN AND FACILITATE AN AMAZING PROJECT EXPERIENCE<br></strong>When attacking a challenge, envision the entire experience from beginning to end so that the teams can focus on solving the challenge. At Bulldog Drummond, we begin by defining success with the project leaders and then choose an inspiring offsite venue and&#xA0;bring 5 to 10 cross-functional teams together. We make sure there is homework completed in advance preparing the teams for their time together, including gathered research, trends, and suggested work in the field. Next, we design the experience&#x2014;from music and food, to a range of carefully facilitated exercises&#x2014;and we model a&#xA0;passionate curiosity to solve the problem.&#xA0;At the end of the one or two days we always have amazing, actionable outcomes. If energy, fun and a healthy dose of competition are included throughout a 1 to 2 day summit, it will always unlock the power of your people and/or your teams.<strong>STEP 5: &#xA0;ACT QUICKLY ON THE OUTCOMES <br></strong>There is never a shortage of actionable ideas that come out of our working summits. The key to success is to ensure that the ideas are not lost because they haven&#x2019;t been framed correctly, or they don&#x2019;t get the time and attention due to the day-to-day activities. Make sure that post the summit, the learnings and outcomes are synthesized in a compelling way, and that a project champion is chosen to lead the ideas into development.Don&#x2019;t think time or resources are an excuse not to bring your best people together. A designed learning experience for your team will solve the biggest challenges and uncover amazing, innovative opportunities for change.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Business is about creating value for someone. That someone is a person, generally with a problem to solve or a desire to fulfill. Sure businesses need to generate profits, but profits are a lagging indicator of creating great value for a lot of &#x201C;special someones.&#x201D; When is the last time you felt treated like a person with a problem (or a desire) by a business?I recently had a personal experience when I ordered a new printer for my home office so my wife, an interior designer, can show her clients photos and decorating ideas (to solve their problems and meet their desires). The company who sold it to us made it very easy to order and had it sent directly to my house (wow!). But once it was up and running it made a terrible clacking sound that made me think some serious damage had occurred in the roller mechanism (ugh!). Now I was congratulating myself on having purchased the &#x201C;on-site&#x201D; service contract so someone could come and fix it for free (phew!).So I called the service company only to learn that I had an &#x201C;extended&#x201D; service contract that didn&#x2019;t kick in until the manufacturer&#x2019;s one-year warrantee expired (uh, oh&#x2026;). With rising trepidation, I made a second phone call to the manufacturer, only to be passed through several phone trees and routing screens (so annoying!) but clinging to the hope that this would all get fixed easily (please!). When the actual, appropriate service agent, Sondra, understood my situation she said, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry, I&#x2019;m going to help you!&#x201D; in such a sincere and warm way that I calmed down immediately.She told me she&#x2019;d heard of this problem before and it was going to be an easy fix (yay!). I believe she really understood how frustrating it was for me to spend my time solving a problem that I already thought was solved and instead of being bored, defensive, or just plain mean, she treated me like a person with a problem. This company is Lexmark, by the way, and I hope this agent represents a systematic understanding of their customers, not just a lucky draw by me.This approach is not simply a nice way to treat people&#x2014;it builds relationships that have real monetary value. I am significantly more likely to buy more Lexmark products because of the way I was treated on that phone call instead of being frustrated with the damage that occurred during shipping and never buying from them again. There is additional value to Lexmark because they are also able to discover problems in their supply chain they can fix to avoid having this be an ongoing hit to their bottom line.What I experienced is actually an established phenomenon in marketing. That is, a customer who experiences a service or product failure, followed by a highly effective service recovery seems to be more loyal than a customer who didn&#x2019;t experience a failure at all. This is known as the <a href=\"http://blog.vovici.com/blog/bid/35953/The-Service-Recovery-Paradox-No-Excuse-for-Bad-Service\" target=\"_blank\">service recovery paradox</a>.This is not to suggest that ineffective service followed by an outstanding service recovery is a good way to run your business. The point here is that sometimes things don&#x2019;t work as planned, and if you and your team demonstrate empathy with your customer (a person who is now frustrated or disappointed) you have an opportunity to surprise and delight them by acting quickly and demonstrating genuine concern for their situation, and making it right.A friend of mine just told me about his daughter having a brand new Apple MacBook stolen from her only moments after buying it. She had just purchased it for college and set the bag down while shopping in another store at the mall. When she bent down to gather her stuff, it was gone! Sad and in shock, they went back to the Apple store to explain what happened, and the Store Manager gave her a replacement totally free. I&#x2019;m sure there are plenty of examples where Apple has let someone down, but on the whole, Apple is considered a company with exceptional product design and outstanding retail service, which is perhaps why they are the most financially successful company on the planet.The key to success in this kind of problem solving is empathy. If you have real empathy for the people you call customers, then you&#x2019;ll naturally want to help them solve their problems, achieve their aspirations, meet their goals, and fulfill their desires. These are all emotional elements of being human and require authentic connection from you to them.I noted the emotional highs and lows I felt during my printer transaction to illustrate the opportunities where my relationship could be won or lost at various points in my experience with Lexmark. Businesses that expect and understand emotional swings are far more likely to earn trust and gain repeat business, thus benefiting from the <a href=\"http://www.loyaltyrules.com/loyaltyrules/effect_overview.html\" target=\"_blank\">loyalty effect</a>.Yes, emotions are difficult to understand and take time to manage. But customers are not transactions you can optimize&#x2014;they are messy, emotional contradictions that need your help. Customers are people, and people connect through relationships.Thankfully for those of us who really like a rational basis for running a business, there is a very clear economic value to having better relationships with your customers versus &#x201C;one and done&#x201D; transactions. Better relationships lead to higher profits due to less churn and more <a href=\"http://www.netpromoter.com/why-net-promoter/know/\" target=\"_blank\">promoter</a> behavior. Better customer relationships have a positive effect on employees as well, increasing their productivity and lowering negative costs associated with turnover and absenteeism.Businesses that seek to maximize the return on their investments by shaving costs out of products and distributing them at mass scale are not wrong, they are just incomplete. Cost containment and efficiencies are necessary, but not sufficient for sustainable success. To achieve sustainable success with customers and create real business value, you must recognize the messy human aspects of customers&#x2014;and deal with them successfully. Customers are people with a problem to solve or a desire to fulfill. Become their partner and commit to a relationship through the good and the bad in order to succeed over the long-term.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

They enable the world to tell stories. Industries such as film, healthcare, architecture and a large part of the video game industry use their software and innovative technologies to create real-time graphic experiences. The brand powers 70% of all augmented and virtual reality content that is created today.We had a conversation with Dave Rhodes, Chief Revenue Officer at Unity, about this customer-centric brand and how it has shifted from a product-focused company to a developer-first company.&#x201C;Our mission is not a bunch of words, it guides our decisions every day and has enabled us to create a community.&#x201D;Unity&#x2019;s mission is to democratize technology&#x2014;take something that&#x2019;s historically been complex and out of reach for most people and give it to everyone. Our mission is not a bunch of words, it guides our decisions and has enabled us to create a community of developers worldwide. This development community is a competitive advantage because we have a great fanbase creating great content.&#x201C;We solve hard problems.&#x201D;We focus on creating success for our customers. It&#x2019;s about supporting them and helping them meet their goals. Sometimes that means helping them create products, sometimes that means making money, sometimes its helping to create art for a not-for-profit&#x2014;success comes in all forms.&#x201C;We put out a fully featured version of core products and we don&#x2019;t charge for them.&#x201D;Free products tend to be trial based or limited. We provide the product without limits. We want people to use it. We want people to be successful. We have terms and conditions outlined for when we believe we should be paid. However, offering our product without cost forces us to be creative about how we monetize the community that we&#x2019;ve created. We&#x2019;ve done well, but we&#x2019;ve been unconventional in terms of the rest of the software industry. Sure, we&#x2019;re a for-profit, we make money, we&#x2019;re sophisticated, but it is all in service of the individual developer.&#x201C;The underlying culture is focused on the developers.&#x201D;The company itself has moved from a product-first focus to developer-first. And what I mean by that is whether it&#x2019;s in the games industry or outside, we&#x2019;ve started to work with developers to think about priorities and innovation. We&#x2019;ve evolved to spending time in the field and working with them to get the insights to understand the product cycle process.&#x201C;We embrace FBI: Field-Based Innovation.&#x201D;We provide source code access to our developer community when they want it and need it. We work with them on real projects in real time&#x2014;simulations to video games to filming a movie. We put ourselves in a position to modify and build on top of the product capabilities to create differentiation for our customers. We take that field-based innovation and evaluate whether it applies on a broader scale, and if so, we integrate it into our products and present it to the real world.&#xA0;&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t think about the revenue and you&#x2019;ll be more successful than you ever imagined.&#x201D;An important part of <em>brand</em> is based on creating an experience. The uncommon principle Unity follows is to think beyond dollar returns. We don&#x2019;t think about short-term ROI of a product, a solution or a customer we engage with. We focus on the developer&#x2019;s insights and innovation for that product, and that&#x2019;s what leads to success.&#xA0; &#xA0;&#x201C;A world of visual computing is coming faster than you think.&#x201D;In the same way that mobile changed many industries, visual computing will change how we learn, communicate and make purchases in the future. Unity is the core for helping to accelerate the world&#x2019;s shift to visual computing. It&#x2019;s the early days of the virtual computer and lots of brands are experimenting. Experiment, but don&#x2019;t put garbage out there. Work with experts in AR and VR that match the value of your brand.&#xA0;To get a taste of what Unity offers, <a href=\"https://unity3d.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">download</a>&#xA0;their product and start building your creation.

       "content_body":"<strong>Where there is happiness you will find success</strong>The path to personal or corporate happiness can be found in the simple, yet powerful, equation of mixing a healthy dose of generosity toward others, with equal parts of gratitude for the good things in your life.People or companies who show their appreciation and gratitude attract the admiration and interest of those around them. And, grateful people stand out in a crowd with their&#xA0;intriguing and infectious&#xA0;energy by attracting interest, curiosity, conversation and friendship. &#xA0;After &#x201C;I love you&#x201D;, saying &#x201C;Thank you&#x201D; is probably the most affirming and energizing statement that we can use toward one another, especially when it&#x2019;s combined with total sincerity.Together, these powerful, positive words help to fuel a grateful and happy heart.&#xA0;Brands that show their appreciation and gratitude inspire and attract loyal fans with a natural curiosity to engage more actively.This powerful combination is quite the opposite from individuals and brands who&#xA0;are self-centered and focused on self-promotion. They lack the depth of relationship to move from a fan to a real friend.<strong>Buy your friend a coffee instead of yourself. It will make you a happier person.</strong><br> Recent studies found the Uncommon Sense principle, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s better to&#xA0;give than to receive&#x201D; provides a rich groundwork for innovation in relationship development and customer retention. Spending money on others, or giving to charity puts a bigger smile on your face than buying things for yourself, according to Michael Norton, a professor at Harvard Business School. Most people think that if you make more money you are going to be happier, but it actually doesn&#x2019;t have a huge impact on overall happiness. But, how you spend does make a tangible difference.Norton&#x2019;s study examined how much people earn, how they spend,&#xA0;and&#xA0;asked them to rate their own happiness. Regardless of income, the people who spent money on others reported an increase in personal happiness, while those who spent more on themselves did not.<strong>Do what you say and say what you do.<br> </strong>The literal meaning of sincerity is a virtue in which we do what we say we&#x2019;re going to do&#x2014;it&#x2019;s speaking and acting truthfully. And for many it&#x2019;s very hard to follow through on. Sincerity and authenticity are close relatives, and brands&#xA0;and the people who manage them are striving to be more&#xA0;authentic. There&#x2019;s an opportunity to deliver on both with energy and determination that shows caring and consideration for others, helping to differentiate one brand from another.<strong>UNCOMMON SENSE GUIDE TO HAPPINESS</strong><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "principle":"SCHOOLING YOU",
       "content_body":"It&#x2019;s the beginning of another amazing school year where millions of students across the U.S. follow their dreams. From the changing colors of trees in Princeton to the lush greenery of Berkeley, a new school year is about to unfold, and along with it, the future leaders of the private and public sectors. It is a time of wonder and a time of adaptation, along with hard work and long hours.Innovative thinking may be brought about by topics like studying Einstein&#x2019;s Gravity Theory or the latest Cloud Computing trends in the sciences or the works of Plato or Rembrandt regarding the arts. The human mind is capable of many wonderful things and the ability to synthesize and act upon information is one of them. As a result, schools and teachers must provide not only course guidance, but the ability to foster forward thinking to create an enlightening experience for students. However, the learning process is a two-way street. Not only must teachers teach, but students must be involved in the learning process to truly enrich themselves.It is the responsibility of the teacher to make the course as interesting as possible for their students, so they are &#x201C;pulled into&#x201D; the subject. For example, how virtualization is applied in Cloud Computing can take on many forms and make for a very interesting component regarding this highly popular topic. What one can do in the Cloud Computing space is also where the creative factor comes into play. Let&#x2019;s look at an instrument like a chronograph watch to gain a better understanding of student capabilities. If a student does not take full interest in a course, then it is much like having the watch tell only time. However, if the teacher can manage to get the student involved, then it is much like activating the push piece on the watch and starting the stopwatch capability of the chronograph.Similarly, a business owner or company manager faces the same situation. If an employee is not engaged with their position within the company, it&#x2019;s much like &#x201C;putting in time&#x201D; rather than working toward a common goal of company success. Rather, teachers, managers and company owners alike should work to spark interest for their employees, offering them the ability to engage and become actively involved, with various methods of future development and applicable learnings. This activation equates to developing an interest, which then promotes motivation and the creative thinking process.People are usually filled with wonderment as they set off on a new school year, new job, or new position within a company&#x2014;followed by peer pressure, difficulties adapting to surroundings, balancing healthy workloads, and dealing with a range of emotions and distractions. It is up to the individual to not only access and accept what is expected of them, but they must also adapt to their new environment. As a student, the goal is not just to get a passing grade, but truly understand the course material. The student is not only expected to know that Alexander the Great died in 323 B.C. and how his death impacted the Mediterranean, but how political thinking changed in the aftermath. The bottom line is that it&#x2019;s not only important to get good grades, but to also gain a better understanding of the subject matter so it may be properly applied later in life. As a result, honest hard work, along with a passion for the subject matter are needed to take the leaning experience to the next level.The same principle is true for those managing people and businesses. If you are able to create immersive learning experiences for your employees they will be more engaged and able to apply those learnings in the workplace. Conversely they will be able to communicate this knowledge to your customers. Educated employees are passionate employees that care and take ownership in your company leading to a healthy workforce and successful company.And this same principle can be applied to life in general. If what you&#x2019;re doing is meaningless you&#x2019;ll live a life with no meaning. Continuously embracing a childlike curiosity will help to ask why and how, and ultimately lead to a greater understanding of what you&#x2019;re doing, why and the impact it has on the world at large.When we know better, we do better.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

He will be the first to tell you that he doesn&#x2019;t have it all together, but can guarantee you that he&#x2019;s an active participant, enjoying the ride every step of the way. Bob brings joy and happiness to those he meets, and his book is overflowing with life and love lessons that are applicable to individuals, families, executives, employees and world leaders. He&#x2019;s a wise, kind, brave, courageous, wild man who writes in a real and inspiring style. And like Bob, his book doesn&#x2019;t fit a formula.Bob lives life, rather than talking about it or worrying about it. In every chapter of his book he shares the spontaneous, contagious and authentic power of love in action and the lessons from his incredibly unique life experiences, like what he learned from picking up the phone and inviting Attorney General Ashcroft to go to Uganda with him, or sitting outside of a dean&#x2019;s office for weeks begging his way into law school. Bob doesn&#x2019;t do the expected&#x2014;he advocates life like a pickup basketball game. If you&#x2019;ve got a hook shot, bring it. If you&#x2019;re not a good shooter, pass it. Either way, just give all the game you&#x2019;ve got. And while I won&#x2019;t give away any more of the joy from reading his book, I thought I&#x2019;d share my top ten favorite takeaways:1. Your life is not defined by what you believe, it&#x2019;s about what you actively and deliberately participate in.2. Don&#x2019;t be afraid of failing at things that matter, be afraid of succeeding at things that don&#x2019;t.3. Stop thinking you shape circumstances and start letting them shape you.4. Say yes, and see what happens.5. Words don&#x2019;t just describe who you are, they shape who you are.6. Sharing your life with the right people is really important.7. You can learn as much from a Jeep Wrangler as you can from a teacher, you just need to pay attention.8. It&#x2019;s more important to put your time into doing something, rather than putting it into trying to be someone.9. Religion tastes awful, especially when you eat the fake stuff.10. Don&#x2019;t wait for every door to be opened for you, get ready to kick a few down.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span><em>Photo: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/wagnertc/3858594753/sizes/z/in/photostream/\" target=\"_blank\">Wagner T.

For the many positives brought by technology, many have become progressively impersonal. Brands must remember to treat all technology touch-points as an opportunity to connect versus a bunker to hide behind.<em>&#x201C;Promises are like crying babies in a theater, they should be carried out at once.&#x201D; -&#xA0;Norman Vincent Peale.</em><strong>Our words create an experience for others.</strong>Our Words, once given to a friend, colleague, or family become the building block that form who we are and over time define our character and our integrity. They&#x2019;re the foundation for opportunities and relationships.?<br><br>Uncommon advice:<br><br><strong>Words inform actions.</strong> Always make sure to carefully weigh a response. How you say something can be just as important as the actions behind those words.<strong>Stuff happens.</strong> At times circumstances arise that cause us to rethink a promise&#x2026; if an obligation cannot be fulfilled, quickly engage and do whatever it takes to complete the task. Keep your promise in order to maintain brand value.<strong>Keeping your word nurtures your integrity.</strong> Integrity is essential for people to place trust in you. Without trust a brand cannot influence anyone. Influence determines a brand&#x2019;s destiny. It starts by simply keeping a promise, but the affect is honesty and esteem.<strong>Integrity cannot be delegated.</strong> Those in leadership positions must act responsibly, be 110% engaged and take deliberate actions to design and communicate the objectives that are needed for enduring stature. In a company everyone can help enhance the brand; marketing, customer commitment departments can all play a part.The next time you give your word, remember that your commitment, once given, has lasting value and reflects on your character.

But what&#x2019;s inside is rather unexpected. The hotel owners&#x2019; commissioned artists such as Banksy, Sami Musa and Dominique Petrin to customize guest rooms, so people are literally sleeping in a work of art. &#x201C;The hotel sits just 13&#x2019; from the separation wall. Eight of the rooms are adorned with Banksy&#x2019;s art, such as a wall painting depicting an Israeli border policeman and Palestinian man engaged in a pillow fight. Other works are also mischievously political: a bullet-ridden tank that empties water into a hot tub; a bust with a cloth covering its mouth while tear gas (made from cotton) envelops it.&#x201D; -<a href=\"https://www.citylab.com/life/2017/03/banksys-new-venture-shows-a-city-under-occupation/518838/\">CityLab</a>The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/16/world/middleeast/banksy-hotel-bethlehem-west-bank-wall.html\">NYTimes</a> recently featured the hotel saying, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s voyeuristic.

       "content_body":"I take my iPhone with me everywhere. It never leaves my side&#x2014;and as a self-prescribed <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3012432/creative-conversations/are-you-an-idiot\" target=\"_blank\">I.D.I.O.T,</a> it&#x2019;s always on. For some reason, I&#x2019;m convinced that I should look at it every five minutes. It&#x2019;s my adult pacifier that I can&#x2019;t live without, and as a result I have a false sense of connectedness. I&#x2019;m never alone because I&#x2019;m always connected, always surfing, texting and talking&#x2014;and while I love Jony Ive&#x2019;s design brilliance, I despise the dependence and control this device has on me.Fast forward to last Tuesday night when my flight&#xA0;landed at JFK, I reached for my iPhone and discovered the battery was dead. My anxiety level went through the roof. How was I going to check my email, voicemail and texts? How was I going to contact the driver who was circling the airport waiting to pick me up? First World problems can be easily solved, I jumped in the cab line and headed into the city disconnected from the world at large. Behold, I survived the 45-minute ride to the hotel without my phone and my social network. I checked-in at 11:00 pm, starving, and I grabbed a table for one at the hotel restuarant. I rarely eat alone and I make it a rule to never eat alone in New York. This was a sudden act of social bravery. As I sat at a candlelit table and stared out at all of the connected, happy, conversational couples and groups filling the air with chatter, I suddenly felt very alone and socially awkward. People don&#x2019;t eat alone in New York, so what does this say about me? I&#x2019;m alone, I&#x2019;m not interesting enough and I&#x2019;m certainly not talking on my dead phone so I can&#x2019;t look loved, important or connected.Overcoming the feelings of being alone and uncomfortable, I decided (or convinced myself) that I actually liked being at dinner alone and phoneless with no one to talk to or entertain, except myself. I ate dinner slowly, appreciating the tastes and textures more than usual, and I casually observed the crowd. I studied my surroundings and picked up on the moods and attitudes in the room. I became a cultural voyeur, a fly on the wall, and realized what a privilege it is to be alone for small periods of time to relax and reflect. I realized that I like myself just enough to take &#x201C;me&#x201D; out for dinner and have a conversation in my head, watch the world go by, and enjoy recharging my brain.As I sat at the candlelit table, time seemed to slow down just a little. I felt a sense of calm that I don&#x2019;t normally feel when I&#x2019;m eating with others; and I realized I could benefit from being alone and without technology a little more often. I also realized that being a cultural and operational voyeur is an experience that every executive could benefit from. Being in the field and seeing what real people experience is a must. The importance of alone time in a social setting can help to increase ones power of observation, critical thinking and the ability to pay attention to the smallest of details.Here are a few important benefits of a little alone time:<strong>1. Time to be with just you</strong><br> We depend on others for connection, inspiration, energy, and love most of the time. Spending time alone with your own thoughts is revitalizing. It&#x2019;s amazing the conversations you&#x2019;ll start to have with yourself and the ideas that materialize as a result.<strong>2. Time to be silent&#xA0;</strong><br> The only time I&#x2019;m silent is when I&#x2019;m asleep or surfing. Silence is golden, especially when you&#x2019;re surrounded by a lot of talkers and constant ambient noise. Being silent can give you a sense of calm and satisfaction.<strong>3. Time to be disconnected&#xA0;</strong><br> Disconnecting from your phone means you pay attention to, and appreciate the details of your surroundings, of the products you use and the service you receive.<strong>4. Time to be uncomfortable&#xA0;</strong><br> How often do you put yourself in an uncomfortable position? It&#x2019;s a simple way to be comfortable within your discomfort.<strong>5. Time to reflect</strong><br> It&#x2019;s a great way to spend some time reflecting on where you are in life and what&#x2019;s most important to you.<strong>6. Time to observe</strong><br> There&#x2019;s nothing like observing everything going on around you &#x2013; and making note of what you see.<strong>7. Time to appreciate</strong><br> You can be alone in a coffee shop, a restaurant, or on a mountaintop&#x2014;but regardless of where you are, carve out regular alone time to reflect and appreciate what you have.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span><em>Photo: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/marfis75/9147574169/sizes/m/in/photostream/\" target=\"_blank\">Marfis75</a></em>"

       "content_body":"<em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, I had the opportunity to speak to the amazing Creative Mornings community in San Diego about the idea of clarifying values for a new year, helping us to drown out some of the noise and act with intention and purpose </span></em><strong><em>(worksheet download below)</em></strong><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we approach another new year&#x2014;and this time around, a new decade&#x2014;many of us will emerge from the daze of the holidays and start thinking about the year ahead. The start of the year is a great time for reflection, planning and goal-setting. It may be a clich&#xE9; and a marketing tool, but the idea of </span><strong><em>New Year, New You</em></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> holds a lot of promise. It&#x2019;s a fresh start, a reset, an opportunity for change&#x2014;it&#x2019;s all new.&#xA0;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we make it through the last remaining cookies and let ourselves embrace this mindset of newness and change, many will eventually sit down to create a list of New Year&#x2019;s Resolutions. We&#x2019;ve probably all been there. Fitness, finance, diet, career, skills, travel and wellness are among the themes that people turn to most often. Learn a new language, drink less, read more, join a gym, be kinder to your family&#x2014;all virtuous pursuits that would likely change your life for the better.&#xA0;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, why are they so hard to follow through with? Why, according to U.S. News and World Report, do nearly 80% of resolutions get dropped by February? One of the reasons I&#x2019;d submit is this: when we resolve to eat more vegetables, or take up cycling, or write more letters, </span><strong><em>why </em></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">we&#x2019;re doing it isn&#x2019;t always apparent. And when we don&#x2019;t have a purpose, or a </span><strong><em>why,</em></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> behind our actions, there isn&#x2019;t much of a foundation to inspire us to do things consistently over time.&#xA0;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, I&#x2019;d like to encourage you to try something different. Instead of making that list of resolutions and weighing yourself down with a bunch of </span><strong><em>whats</em></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that you will be struggling to maintain come March, consider shifting your attention towards </span><strong><em>why</em></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Instead of New Year&#x2019;s Resolutions, try refreshing your values for the New Year.&#xA0;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here at Bulldog Drummond, we work with brands to identify and define values that help drive behavior and decision making across the organization. Instead of having a laundry list of things to do, it means creating a clear and purposeful set of reasons behind doing. As an individual, clarifying your values can be just as powerful for your personal life, giving meaning to what you choose to do and how you choose to do it. And as you enter another year, having a renewed connection to your values can also lead to real changes that stick with you well past Spring.&#xA0;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ready to ditch the resolutions and get started on values? Use the exercise below to reflect on what&#x2019;s important to you, and then start to organize into themes. From there, give each value a specific name that means something to you and will help inform your decisions and actions throughout the year. The more unique and personal the better.&#xA0;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most importantly, make sure that your values:</span><strong><em>Resonate with you personally</em></strong><strong><em>Support your purpose&#xA0;</em></strong><strong><em>Inspire action</em></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/BulldogDrummond/values-for-a-new-year\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Download our Values Exercise</a> to get started on a new year full of purpose. </span><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Most people don&#x2019;t willingly talk to people they don&#x2019;t know or consider different.Your culture is more inclusive and universal when it happens, your business performs better and your customer experience improves when disparate groups of people&#x2014;i.e. departments&#x2014;actually talk to one another.What are you to do?Before the solution, let&#x2019;s take apart the components.<em>People don&#x2019;t talk to one another</em>Okay, people are not walking around completely silent. Rather, people prefer to talk to people like themselves&#x2014;function, level, age, race, style, interests, energy, etc.&#x2014;and are skeptical of people not like them or new to the tribe. It&#x2019;s science, more specifically, it&#x2019;s neuroscience. The brain is wired for this &#x201C;in-group&#x201D; &#x201C;out-group&#x201D; sorting and it happens non-consciously.When you take this in-group notion as truth, add in the amount of work organizations ask people to do daily, and sprinkle a dash of ego on top, it is virtually inevitable for silos to form in organizations as they grow and a shared culture to become faction-laden.Taking it to a basic human level, another reason for the lack of face-to-face, relationship-building, empathy-inducing conversation in your organization (and society) is that people don&#x2019;t know how to do it.The ever-present devices in our hands allow us to remain connected to, and only to, the people (or more accurately, the digital personas) we want. We have forgotten how to simply get to know someone without an agenda. We overestimate the sting of rejection from trying to make a connection, even if we are coworkers. We struggle to be brave in the uncomfortable moments when silence between talking can seem like minutes, not seconds. And, we can&#x2019;t swipe left to end an in-person conversation if it doesn&#x2019;t engage us.In summation, we are destined to become analog loners, except in the rarest of circumstances, only connected to people exactly like us. Possible, but I refuse to go quietly into the night, and you should rage against the dying of connection as well.<em>Your culture and performance of your business requires it</em>So what if I don&#x2019;t know people at work outside of the ten-foot radius of my desk? That&#x2019;s what the directory is for when I need something, right? As the illustrious Lee Corso says, &#x201C;not so fast, my friend.&#x201D;Your culture reflects the norms of everyone. Lack of relationships lead to silos, which lead to an organization with mini-cultures, some great, some not-so-great. On the other hand, diverse relationships and perspectives matter to engagement in work, make the organization more efficient when accomplishing cross-functional initiatives and are the lifeblood for innovation. Not to mention, they bring a general richness to human existence which, at least to me, seems totally worth it.If employees are connected beyond a corporate directory, email address or phone number, they will feel more comfortable to reach out directly to one another, less likely to assume someone is intentionally doing (or not doing) something and more likely to give them the benefit of the doubt when a perceived mistake is made. These benefits move work along faster, suppresses the inevitable politics and produces higher quality output.<em>What can you do?</em>Simply, force moments of serendipity (FMOS) is defined as: <em>An experience forcing together two or more people who don&#x2019;t normally hangout and providing the impetus for a seemingly innocuous connection, which often leads to a fortuitous one.</em>Example, a company I worked for provided lunch to team members with one important provision. You could not eat at your desk. This required people to share tables&#x2014;i.e. find whatever place was available&#x2014;and gave a common talking point, food. Folks from accounts receivable conversed with the creatives, human resources with technology and operations with real estate.As an equation, FMOS = Time + Space + CatalystThe time and space component of FMOS can come in many forms &#x2013; from company functions and odd activities, daily or weekly meals, a general understanding that breaks are actually okay, architecture of shared spaces, company gyms and office swapping to name a few. Even with time and space allotments, people will still tend flock to whom they know, stay to themselves or headphone-up. Hence, a reason to connect is needed.Catalysts come in many forms as well. The goal of a catalyst is to ignite a conversation in a largely unthreatening way with a common touchpoint. It can be as simple as a quote or question of the day in a strategic place. Seating arrangements at meetings and trainings. Inclusive during and after-work events. A game or competition (my favorite was the annually egg joust we had at my previous company, which started with 15 people attending year one and had more than 60 by year three).And don&#x2019;t underestimate the hidden power of silence. People are uncomfortable with silence. If people are forced together for long enough without the ability to escape, one person won&#x2019;t be able to stand the silence and will say something. By all means, find a way to slow down your office coffeemaker; put the Keurig on sloth speed and watch relationships bloom.Regardless of how well-designed and intentioned your FMOS will be, each individual has a decision to make in these moments with &#x201C;strangers&#x201D;. My advice is to choose kindness, take a risk to connect and push through the discomfort.The worst that can happen is you&#x2019;ll end up back where you started, in solitude and silence, with just a momentary feeling of rejection.The best that will happen is beautiful moment of serendipity with lasting, unintended benefits, one of whom may even be a&#x2014;gasp&#x2014;new friend at work, or at least someone you&#x2019;d give a head nod to as you pass in the hall.&#xA0;<em>Read more from <a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/author/mark-tomaszewicz#filters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mark</a>.</em><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

The daily grind can often take hold of our lives and we lose connection with what it means to be human. Exploration. Intrigue. Imagination. Discovery. Looking at things&#x2014;anything really&#x2014;through a different lens can have a marked effect on how we think and behave.<strong>If You Want to Be Interesting Be Interested</strong>Night adventures can be an exercise in persistence and determination.

Get out and see what you can find while the rest of the world sleeps.<strong>Follow Your Curiosity</strong>Perhaps the best thing about late night adventures is the juxtaposition. Exploring an area of the city that we interact with during the day, being bewildered by how beautiful and mysterious the same location is at night. It teaches you to look beyond face value, sparks imagination and boosts creativity while changing your perception of common spaces.With the oversaturation of people in the creative industry, doing mediocre work is not an option. There is a need to stand apart and do things differently. Seeing everything in a different light is crucial to creating good design. As with any good things in life, good design requires hard work. It&#x2019;s not always easy to get yourself up and out &#x2013; but seeing the world from a different perspective allows you to see life in a fresh, new way. Push yourself and trust what will come out of the struggle.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Leading a company towards innovation is difficult&#x2014;but it&#x2019;s possible. You might ask yourself: <em>How can I continue to improve in my leadership role?&#xA0; How can I move my business forward and create a lasting impact? What can I do today to guarantee my company is the best it can be? </em>While there is no silver bullet, rejuvenating passion and realizing potential can help establish the legacy you want create for your company. And what we&#x2019;ve found at <a href=\"http://www.livingfullout.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Living Full Out</a> is that it&#x2019;s the combination of one&apos;s purpose and one&apos;s professional position that creates highly effective leaders.<strong>Aligning purpose for a common goal</strong>Recognizing their purpose allows management to amplify their presence within a company. They become empowered to change the game, create momentum and transfer their enthusiasm to their employees. Using this energy, leaders can tap into their team&#x2019;s abilities and blow away limits. By allowing personal empowerment to effect their professional role, leaders can redefine the way they conduct business. Because it&#x2019;s only after discovering a leader&#x2019;s personal purpose that goals and strategies can be established that will benefit the company and its progression towards innovation.&#xA0;&#xA0;Across every industry, companies are looking for newer, better and more advanced ways to innovate. An essential element of this progress, and a key to its success, is dynamic leadership&#x2014; leadership that displays urgency and optimism within an organization. At Living Full Out, we have discovered that our best work occurs when we embody this type of leadership in each of our individual roles, searching for better ways to reach our client community. This kind of dedication stimulates pride and excitement in our personnel and creates excellent results.<strong>Cultivating innovation through dynamic leadership</strong>For any business, innovation can be cultivated by evaluating and improving existing company operations and searching for gaps in performance. By honing critical thinking and analytical skills, management can create a more proficient way to conduct their business. But at the end of the day, leaders are responsible for their employees. So how can they ensure that their staff continues to do top-notch work&#x2014;by being trailblazers who inspire their employees through constructive feedback and action, adding value in areas where it lacks and creating an encouraging work environment where innovation can prosper, reflective of inspired guidance. It&#x2019;s through this adoption of a productive work ethic and the proficient allocation of resources that leaders can harness innovation.<strong>Give employees room to be flexible and versatile when problem-solving</strong>There is no one right way to revolutionize a company&#x2014;being versatile is key in finding a method that suits a business and its mission. <em>But what does it mean to be versatile? How can it lead to innovation?</em> Through flexibility, leaders can alter the development of their company, changing its course for the better. In this environment, employees have the freedom to adapt in their positions and the liberty to be more creative, giving them the confidence to self-manage.When faced with new situations or the need to respond to a problem, we have found that versatility is essential in being innovative. Flexibility allows one to be fluid in their actions and use forward-thinking to dictate the business&#x2019;s next steps. This is critical in creating a company that is always moving forward.<strong>Employees are the lifeblood of any business</strong>They are a community, a group of people, working tirelessly towards a common goal, providing unique and excellent service to customers. Leaders will ask themselves: <em>How will innovation affect my employees? How can my team bring change to customers?</em>Brainstorming new ideas and methods of connecting with consumers will strengthen any business&#x2019;s mission. By analyzing a company&#x2019;s consumer demographics, employees can present their business with a more customized style, tailoring their approach for the individual customer. Innovation is hard, but it&#x2019;s an exciting opportunity that can drive a company towards evolving their vision. While it&#x2019;s difficult, innovation can open doors for company leaders&#x2014;if they&#x2019;re willing to walk through them.Discovering your purpose as a business can guide your employees to grow individually and professionally, and having leaders that embrace their roles, inspiring others by example, can help spur innovation within your organization. Exercising versatility will also allow your company to ignite each team member&#x2019;s potential, sparking passion throughout the company. Working as a team and thinking like a community will help you provide better, more innovative services to your customers. In all this, advancement and evolution is possible by innovating with purpose and living full out.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"If you haven&#x2019;t noticed, the Next Economy is here. Every single industry, domain and business is being disrupted by emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data, virtual reality, augmented reality, blockchain, internet of things, drones and 3D printing.<br><br>Technology is shaping everything that happens around us. From the way we work, operate, serve customers, collaborate, create and deliver value; it&#x2019;s all changing. Technology will fundamentally challenge your business model. This means that existing business models will change or be replaced by new ones; while this is obvious to you and me it isn&#x2019;t for everyone.I recently spent a week in Mexico City working on a new product I&#x2019;m co-developing with another company. Our collaboration is a classic case of new meets old, where I&#x2019;m the new and they are the old. I get this incredible feeling when I collaborate with people who want to change things for the better, but it&#x2019;s also incredible to spend time with people who are anchored in the status quo, so convinced that they&#x2019;re right that they fight to maintain it.Why is it incredible to spend time with people anchored in the status quo?Because no matter how obvious it is, and they seem to get it, that technology is changing how they do things they still rationalize ways it isn&#x2019;t. A usual quip is &#x201C;oh that&#x2019;s not going to happen here&#x201D; or &#x201C;it&#x2019;s going to take awhile before it happens&#x201D;. This is a clear sign of a playing not to lose mindset, and it&#x2019;s very common anywhere you go; not just in Mexico.The dafult state of every new idea is no, and every single innovator has to figure out a way to turn that no into a yes. It&#x2019;s not easy because <a href=\"http://www.game-changer.net/2016/07/28/why-people-resist-new-technologies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">people are resistant to technology</a>&#xA0;because they&#x2019;re afraid of losing what they&#x2019;ve built, what sustains them. This is &#x201C;the messy part about innovation&#x201C;, what no one talks about because they opted for an easier path. But the truth is change is messy, and no one is immune to it.We don&#x2019;t say &#x201C;Innovate or die&#x201D; to sound interesting and brave, but because it&#x2019;s very true. You have to disrupt yourself, before someone disrupts you.Thinking different isn&#x2019;t enough, you have to act different.The company I&#x2019;m collaborating with is open minded, but acting differently is a completely different story. Being open minded isn&#x2019;t enough, you have to act to truly challenge your assumptions. You see, legacy industries that have survived the information technology phase must now truly become technology companies at their core. Think about it this way: You&#x2019;re either <a href=\"http://www.game-changer.net/2015/08/14/in-the-future-you-are-either-a-digital-business-or-a-dead-business/#.WeUmhkyZOcY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a digital business or a dead business</a>; and it applies to everyone.This requires developing new capabilities and business models, which means getting out of your comfort zone. To do so is to face the same digital transformation challenges every established organization has: existing practices, standards and culture.For example, my collaborators have a very standarized process that they&#x2019;ve optimized throughout the years. And they have a deep need to maintain those standards because it makes their work predicable and their business sustainable. So, it&#x2019;s not surprising that they immediately went up in arms when I came in and challenged their standards.Keeping up with technology requires experimentationCompanies fail for many reasons, one of them is because they miss the future. The reason they miss the future is because success breeds failure. You see, any company that&#x2019;s been successful for some time will develop a very specific competence that they can repeat infinitely, but it&#x2019;s this competence that impedes them from growing beyond that. As Bill Taylor says, &#x201C;<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2011/11/dont-let-what-you-know-limit-w\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">What you know limits what you can imagine</a>&#x201C;.You have to imagine possibilities and take action, because your existing business model is based on a specific set assumptions which will not be true forever; in order to shift your perspective you have to challenge them. A big challenge for every organization and their leaders is keeping up with technology, not just understanding it but being able to think through the possibilities it enables and the opportunities it creates.Organizations that drive disruption understand that change isn&#x2019;t about rationalizing why something won&#x2019;t happen, it&#x2019;s about considering how things could be better if you decide to do something about it.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

A democracy will continue to exist up&#xA0;until the time that voters discover that they can vote themselves&#xA0;generous gifts from the public treasury. From that moment on, the&#xA0;majority always votes for the candidates who promise the most benefits&#xA0;from the public treasury, with the result that every democracy will&#xA0;finally collapse over loose fiscal policy, (which is) always followed&#xA0;by a dictatorship.&#x201D;&#x201C;The average age of the world&#x2019;s greatest civilizations from the&#xA0;beginning of history, has been about 200 years. During those 200&#xA0;years, these nations always progressed through the following sequence:&#xA0;From bondage to spiritual faith; From spiritual faith to great&#xA0;courage; From courage to liberty; From liberty to abundance; From&#xA0;abundance to complacency; From complacency to apathy; From apathy to&#xA0;dependence; From dependence back into bondage.&#x201D;If we&#x2019;re going to avoid this path, it&#x2019;s time for the leaders of this country to start leading. It&#x2019;s time for them to open their eyes and ears and listen to what the country expects of them: responsible decisions that will put us on a path of sustainable growth. It&#x2019;s time to close their mouths and stop jockeying for popularity, worrying about&#xA0;reelection, and focus on formulating a path to break the status quo. Now is the time for them to shut off the rhetoric, the posturing,&#xA0;backbiting and finger pointing and&#xA0;step up and make the hard decisions to restore this country&#x2019;s stature as a nation that can be trusted.

We recently had the opportunity to talk to Matt Clifford, Co-founder of Barnana, more in depth about their humble approach to leadership and dedication to their people&#x2014;and how that plays a role in every step the brand takes.Matt shared the four uncommon truths that leaders should consider.<strong><em>&#x201C;Leaders should serve.&#x201D;<br></em></strong>The moment Matt shifted his leadership approach to a more servant one was in the initial stages of business. One of their sales associates shared they were pregnant and starting a family. <em>&#x201C;It hit me, people are depending on me.&#x201D; Matt said, &#x201C;Families are being created.&#x201D;</em> He realized that there&#x2019;s so much more to leadership than simply leading the charge. It is about caring for people, providing support and sometimes putting their needs above your own.<strong><em>&#x201C;If you ask a lot of your people, you need to give them a lot.&#x201D;<br></em></strong>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s so much more to business than making money and doing good. It&#x2019;s about taking care of people and providing for their wellbeing. It&#x2019;s about appreciating them and keeping them fired up and energized about what they do.&#x201D;<strong><em>&#x201C;The experience is all about your people.&#x201D;<br></em></strong>Barnana approaches their brand experience from a macro level. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s more important for us to have a brand experience that&#x2019;s connected at each touchpoint&#x2014;a common ethos, congruent.&#x201D; Matt said, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s all about people. You have to hire the right people that believe in what you&#x2019;re doing. If you do the people thing right, you have an unstoppable company.<strong><em>&#x201C;If you want to change, change your people.&#x201D; <br></em></strong>&#x201C;You can&#x2019;t fake who you are. Embrace your brand. It&#x2019;s about being real. It&#x2019;s something you believe. Everyone on your team needs to have ownership of the product. Consumers are smart, they intuitively know when a brand is being authentic versus trying to sell them something. Brands are only as creative and authentic as their people are.&#x201D;<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span><em>Photo: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/barnana/\" target=\"_blank\">Barnana</a></em>"

       "content_body":"At Bulldog, we love to celebrate. Of course we honor all of the major holidays, but we also look for little reasons to pop open a bottle of good champagne throughout the year&#x2014;even reasons as seemingly mundane as the weather. In the U.S., we still look for the groundhog&apos;s shadow each February, but there are uncommon weather holidays spanning the globe that we&apos;re equally as excited to celebrate.&#xA0;St. Swithun&apos;s Day is a celebrated holiday inspired by weather folklore in the United Kingdom each July 15th.&#xA0;According to the legend, it&apos;s believed that if it rains on St. Swithun&apos;s Day, it will rain continuously for the next 40 days. If the weather is fair, 40 days of pleasant temperatures will follow.The tradition dates back to the mid-ninth century when St. Swithun of Winchester was laid to rest with a simple request, to be buried in the churchyard where rain could grace his grave. His posthumous wish was granted for over a hundred years until one year on July 15 when his body was exhumed and moved inside the cathedral&#x2014;and a great storm ensued.As it turns out, weather patterns typically begin to change mid-summer so chances are the storm was the result of climate patterns rather than a disgruntled saint. But nonetheless, we&apos;re recognizing this day as a nod to history and centuries-old beliefs.&#xA0;And to those of us residing in California and preserving ever drop of water in our current water crisis, we&apos;d happily invite St. Swithun here for an extended stay and hold out hope that the old wive&apos;s tale may still hold a bit of truth.&#xA0;<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"<a href=\"https://weather.com/news/weather/news/2017-10-20-billion-dollar-weather-disasters-united-states-record-tied\">$16-billion dollar weather disasters</a> have affected the US this year, from January &#x2013; October. And the year isn&#x2019;t over. We all knew someone, or personally experienced these events &#x2013; from hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria to the more recent wildfires in California. These traumatic events have taken a physical and emotional toll on many.Living in Florida, hurricane season is one we plan for and anticipate every year. But always with a wait and see mentality. This year may be quiet, with little impact to our homes, or it may be <em>the</em> year where we experience the storm of the century. Having just watched the unexpected impact of hurricane Harvey to our neighbors across the Gulf, here in Florida, we watched the path of hurricane Irma with great anxiety. In the days before hurricane Irma was scheduled to make landfall, Governor Scott called for a State of Emergency. The skies were blue, social and professional events went on as scheduled, but the environment was charged. Water became scarce in the stores. Group chats permeated social media. We all accessed the local news channels and apps with more frequency as we sought the most up-to-date information on the direction of the storm, and the potential impact to different regions of the state of Florida. Who would be impacted, how badly, and when?<span id=\"more-4683\"></span>Individuals began to be distracted from their day-to-day as they considered what would be the best decision for their family and those they cared about. Some took to the stores, others to the road. Emergency personnel prepared their plan for how to take care of those who stayed or had nowhere else to go. Anxiety was high, but always seemed to settle a bit once a decision was made and a course of action was committed to.Living in the Tampa Bay area, my family and I made the decision to &#x2018;hunker down,&#x2019; along with many of our neighbors, and began the process of preparing for Irma&#x2019;s pending landfall &#x2013; specific location was still to be determined &#x2013; and to protect those we cared for. I decided to put my professional responsibilities at work to the side for a few days while focusing on the days that were to follow, but it occurred to me that as we were preparing for the storm, many of my clients were dealing with similar situations inside their organizations, weathering storms of their own.Whether navigating acquisitions like Amazon&#x2019;s provocative purchase of Whole Foods or Coach&#x2019;s announcement to purchase Kate Spade, strategically managing the effect of <a href=\"https://www.business.com/articles/shawn-overcast-leadership-turf-battle/\">leadership transitions</a>, or shifts in market strategy requiring new or different skillsets, such as moving from a face-to-face to a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2015/11/11/what-should-digital-transformation-mean-to-your-business/#7e8564707ffc\">digital strategy</a>, or serving customers in a brick-and-mortar fashion, versus serving them <a href=\"https://www.eater.com/2017/9/18/16306748/food-delivery-mobile-app-restaurant-design-operations\">in their own home</a> &#x2013; organizations across the US and beyond are experiencing mini-corporate traumas. And many people in those organizations are suffering.In the professional work we do to support leaders and their organizations through such transitions, we study the real impact to people. What can they do when faced with impending change? And what can leaders in those organizations do to help?<strong>Step 1. Decide and Commit</strong>With forces like Mother Nature, there is little certainty as to who will be affected, and in what way. We seek as much information from our local news outlets and local leadership as we can get our hands on, but that intel could change dramatically before the next scheduled update. Therefore, we must <strong>make decisions</strong> with the information we have, to the best of our ability.With hurricane Irma, I stayed abreast of the most up-to-date information I could about the storm, and consulted several reputable sources. As you determine how to weather your storm, first gather as much information as possible, and then make a decision and <strong>commit to a course of action</strong>. For example, ask yourself, am I going to stay and ride this out or am I going to leave? Once a course of action is committed to, everyone can begin to focus their mental energy and enthusiasm in a single direction.<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/25/business/leadership-lessons-from-the-shackleton-expedition.html\">Ernest Shackleton</a>, a polar explorer who led three British expeditions to the Antarctic, served as a role model for how a commitment to one&#x2019;s mission can present an opportunity to exhibit the effect of leadership decisions and behaviors on a team. While he may have had to shift his mission along the way as he received new information, he was able to effectively lead his team and keep them focused every step of the way.<strong>Step 2. Prepare and Focus</strong>Once a decision is made, take some time to <strong>strategically plan</strong> for how you will carry out that decision, so that you are prepared to execute. One of my clients was a leader within a company that was recently acquired. As the Director of Learning &amp; Development, she felt it was her responsibility to stay and help take care of others who wanted to do the same.&#xA0; Even without promise of a new job, she made a plan for how she would spend her days with the company and how she would manage through ambiguity. She sought to define what resources she would need, what support she had access to, and what support she would have to give, and took inventory of what resources she still had access to &#x2013; with respect to people and budget. Her preparation to carry out her mission, or decision to stay, resulted in a roadmap of activities that engaged every member of her team in a meaningful way, and empowered everyone to have some control over their career, to the best of their ability, while still employed by the legacy company.While waiting for the storm to arrive, or massive change to occur, <strong>harness the mental energy</strong> of your team and help them &#x2013; and yourself &#x2013; to focus on the next action you can take in support of your decision.Give everyone a job. As my family waited for the hurricane to take it&#x2019;s path, we worked to keep our anxieties low and our spirits high. The adults took advantage of the time to prepare new recipes and cook good food, the children got creative in designing <em>Irma&#x2019;s Lounge</em>, or our safe room in the event we would need it later in the evening.<a href=\"https://www.tlnt.com/to-sustain-employee-engagement-you-must-manage-workplace-stress/\">Engage, enable and energize</a> your team to create a sense of control and to help the team focus. Don&#x2019;t allow enough space for rumors or negative energy to overwhelm, but rather create opportunities for the team to engage with one another. Fill silence with communication. And vary the communication. When preparing for a hurricane to make landfall, it&#x2019;s enticing to want to watch hurricane coverage all. day. long. But a quick check in with yourself, you note the rising levels of anxiety and stress. It sure feels good to take a break and watch something light (<em>Impractical Jokers</em>, anyone?), or play a few rounds of <em>Uno</em>.<strong>Take care of you</strong>, too. By modeling well-being practices, you not only do good for your own mind and body, but you eliminate <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/09/make-yourself-immune-to-secondhand-stress\">second-hand stress</a> for all those around you. Think about the classic instruction we all receive when preparing to take-off on an airplane, &#x201C;secure your own mask before assisting others.&#x201D; If you haven&#x2019;t taken care of yourself, you won&#x2019;t have the clarity or energy to help those around you.One way to intentionally take care of yourself is to practice mindfulness, if even for a few minutes at a time. Take a moment to take a breath. The field of psychology gives us research that <a href=\"https://positivepsychologyprogram.com/benefits-of-mindfulness/\">focusing the mind</a> promotes calmness, reduces anxiety, and increases productivity. And more and more business examples tell us that it <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/01/business/at-aetna-a-ceos-management-by-mantra.html?_r=0\">matters</a> to our organizational performance too.Finally, make time to <strong>connect with others</strong>. Connection breeds empathy. Whether part of a neighborhood preparing for a storm, or part of a team preparing for a change, there is a common experience that should be acknowledged and shared. Hurricane Irma brought several of our neighbors together around a dining room table to share the remnants of our freezers and refrigerators &#x2013; before we all lost power. Let this organizational change bring your teams together through team huddles or fireside chats, and allow people to ask questions, share concerns, and get to know each other better.<strong>Step 3. Recover and Refocus</strong>Just because the storm has passed, doesn&#x2019;t mean life goes back to normal. There is no such thing as going back to the way things were. There may be debris in your path, and there can be an emotional crash after holding it together for so long. Allow yourself and your team to go through a period of recovery and reflection.Regardless of whether the storm has a negative or positive impact, emotions after change can range from gratitude, to frustration, to disappointment, to neutral. While we were incredibly grateful our experience with the hurricane resulted in less damage than predicted, I would be lying to say we weren&#x2019;t the least bit disappointed. In some ways it felt like we expended all that energy and emotion of preparing &#x2013; for nothing. But the experience certainly gave us pause and time to reflect. It can be helpful to check in with those around you and to have a shared conversation focused on the following questions:<strong>The only thing that is constant is change.</strong> &#x2013; HeraclitusWe may not be able to predict Mother Nature&#x2019;s next threat, or an organization&#x2019;s next acquisition, but we do know that change will happen again. And we have control over how we weather that storm. Seek opportunities to build your individual, and collective capacity for navigating change.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Have you wondered what&#x2019;s really important in maintaining a long-lasting, meaningful relationship? Ever wondered what that one thing is that keeps two people connected more than almost anything else? I recently told my wife how beautiful she was repeatedly over the span of a weekend. It didn&#x2019;t seem to register with her and I didn&#x2019;t get the response I expected. She seemed a little frustrated and when I asked what the problem was she told me that complimenting her looks made her feel uncomfortable and doesn&apos;t acknowledge her value as a partner in our relationship. It was a good reminder that showing her I genuinely appreciate and care about who she is and what she does is key to showing I understand her.Genuine and heartfelt appreciation is necessary in both personal and professional relationships.<em><br></em>Regardless of the inherent benefits we gain from our marriage or our job, there&#x2019;s nothing more rewarding than feeling that we contribute value and are recognized for it. Recognizing what you appreciate about people is a basic principle that applies to how managers treat their team members, how spouses interact and how brands treat their customers.&#xA0;&#xA0;Everyone wants to feel appreciated because there&#x2019;s almost nothing better than knowing you matter. For many, appreciation is a simple &#x201C;thank you&#x201D;. However, when you&#x2019;re in a relationship &#x201C;thank you&#x201D; is only the beginning. Genuine appreciation that impacts the other person must go beyond the obvious. It has to recognize the specific accomplishment or contribution, and then it must communicate respect and show an understanding of what the person has contributed.&#xA0;Ask yourself if you genuinely apply the power of appreciation in your workplace. Think about how different your colleagues would feel about themselves and the company if they knew that what they did was genuinely noticed and appreciated. Would collaboration, cooperation and creativity increase? Would engagement and loyalty improve? <em>No doubt.</em> &#xA0;<strong>Appreciation fuels positive energy&#xA0;</strong><strong><br></strong>Research year-on-year shows that <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/241649/employee-engagement-rise.aspx\">less than 40% of employees are fully engaged and 13% are actively disengaged</a> in their work.&#xA0;Take a minute on that one. Sit down and get real with your engagement scores, because you&#x2019;ve likely got a challenge to solve and a significant opportunity to unlock. Team members who believe their managers are genuinely interested in their wellbeing and feel valued are more likely to thrive and grow, and as a result positively contribute to the success of the company. When people don&#x2019;t feel appreciated, they tune out and don&#x2019;t contribute their best.&#xA0;<strong>Appreciation increases performance</strong><strong><br></strong>Appreciation and recognition increases engagement and engagement improves performance and value for everyone involved. Kevin Kruse (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Kruse\">@Kruse</a>) describes the ripple effect that employee engagement&#xA0;has on an organization as&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.kevinkruse.com/employee-engagement-research-master-list-of-29-studies/\">The Engagement Profit Chain</a>&#xA0;and it flows from Engaged Employees leading to&#x2026;&#xA0;better service, quality, and productivity, which leads to&#x2026;&#xA0;higher customer satisfaction, which leads to&#x2026;&#xA0;increased sales&#xA0;(repeat business and referrals), which leads to&#x2026;&#xA0;higher levels of profit, which leads to&#x2026;&#xA0;higher shareholder returns.<strong>Appreciation needs specifics</strong><strong><br></strong>Make it a priority to notice what others are doing right and practice being sincere about the specifics. Showing genuine appreciation is about communicating how&#xA0;you&#xA0;feel. Tell the other person what benefit their efforts bring to the organization or to your relationship. Be specific about what you appreciate. Don&#x2019;t just say, &#x201C;You&#x2019;re awesome&#x201D; say, &#x201C;I appreciate how you looked at all sides of the data and you didn&#x2019;t give in until you solved that challenge.&#x201D; Recognize that&#xA0;extra effort applied to a project or performance in tough circumstances. &#x201C;I know we had a tight deadline to meet, and I really appreciate you staying late last night to get the presentation out to FedEx.&#x201D; Appreciate the day-to-day too. Notice when people do things consistently right and thank them for it.&#xA0;<strong>Appreciation requires meaningful actions</strong><strong><br></strong>The power of a&#xA0;handwritten card remains one of the most personal representations of appreciation and recognition that you can send. Evoking deeper meaning than the ostensible &#x201C;thank you&#x201D;. However, there is no limit of great examples, tools and tactics that have been designed to show others how much they are appreciated and recognized.At&#xA0;<a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com\">Bulldog Drummond</a>, we often pass on a little gratitude in the form of suds, sending our favorite brew as a token of gratitude. We do a number of things to create space for people to share gratitude. We eat lunch together at least once a week. We share breakfast on Fridays and start our day with coffee and conversations. We have a #kudos Slack channel that&#x2019;s dedicated to recognizing team members&#x2019; efforts and extraordinary behaviors at work. And we&#x2019;ll send thoughtfully prepared care packages when needed. We also encourage our employees to take one complete afternoon every month &#x2013; what we call Gift of Time &#x2013; to think, ponder, create or recharge.<strong>Appreciating others doesn&#x2019;t&#xA0;come naturally&#xA0;</strong><strong><br></strong>Expressing our appreciation at work is often awkward and doesn&#x2019;t always come naturally. It&#x2019;s not a skill that is taught. Recognizing others for their contribution and being able to genuinely communicate and acknowledge what we see, is a skill that needs to be emphasized with anyone in management. A great place to start is making sure you appreciate&#xA0;<em>you</em>. Take a few moments at&#xA0;the end of the day to ask yourself, <strong><em>&#x201C;What did I accomplish today that I can feel really good about? And what&#xA0;can I improve on tomorrow?&#x201D;</em></strong> Constant self-improvement and self-appreciation will put you in the right mindset to appreciate those around you.<strong>Appreciating consumers doesn&#x2019;t&#xA0;happen enough</strong><strong><br></strong>By now, I hope you&#x2019;re motivated to pay more attention and to show your spouse, your team members and those you work with specific and genuine appreciation for the value they add and the impact they have on others. When I look at the number of loyalty programs that exist and the lack of value and good they deliver, I believe there&#x2019;s a whole new area of business ready to build when it comes to showing customers and guests genuine appreciation for their loyalty.On a parting note, I know that your time is valuable so I&apos;d be remiss to not thank&#xA0;you for taking time out of your day to read this. I hope it nudges you to act, sparks an idea or acts as a reminder of the basics of appreciation.

       "content_body":"America&#x2019;s current state is looking a lot like a multi-national corporation that&#x2019;s completely lost touch with its original vision and mission, and doesn&#x2019;t appear to particularly care about the people it serves. After a period of short-lived success and global notoriety, it racked up a mountain of debt&#x2014;suffocating its competitiveness and creating a&#xA0;massive cash-flow crisis. With leadership gridlock, America can&#x2019;t invest in what matters because it has to service $15 trillion of debt instead.When a distressed company hits this level of financial pain, it implodes&#x2014;declaring bankruptcy, failing or doing a complete turnaround so it can live to fight another day. For a turnaround to stand a chance, leadership needs to agree on a plan, chart a new vision, cut costs and focus on driving the business forward. New leadership needs to be brought in, particularly a CEO who has a proven track record and the leadership skills to mobilize internal teams, strategically deploy assets, partner with suppliers and banks, and direct employees to execute a strategy that moves the business to a clear future state. This new leader must make the tough decisions, fix the things that are fixable and cut the ones that aren&#x2019;t, address the challenges head-on and get the entire team to do their part.To be successful in a turnaround, there are two essential ingredients for transformation. The first is agreeing on the problem that needs to be solved. The second is building trust among all stakeholders so the best minds can come together to solve that problem.<strong>Why can&#x2019;t America employ some of these same tactics? </strong><br> The posturing, noise and rhetoric of Washington has to stop now&#x2014;our leaders must step back, clearly state the problem, agree on a timeframe, roll up their sleeves and work together to actually develop a plan to solve the problem and not just defer it.<strong>The Penny Plan</strong><br> There&#x2019;s one plan on the table that got my attention because it&#x2019;s easy to understand and it gets the job done. The One Percent Spending Reduction Act, or the &#x201C;Penny Plan&#x201D; as it&#x2019;s been coined on Capitol Hill, aims to balance the budget&#xA0;by bringing overall spending down to the historic average for revenues to 18% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Over a ten-year period, the Penny Plan would&#xA0;cut spending by $7.5 trillion and balance the budget by 2019, eliminating our deficits and getting our country back on a path towards fiscal health. So what are we waiting for? Let&#x2019;s tell the story, sign the papers and get on with it.<strong>Ask what you can do for your country</strong><br> It&#x2019;s easy to sit on the sidelines and be critical of our government but it&#x2019;s up to each of us to get involved, rally around the issues we care about and do our part to help solve the problems we face. Our country has a massive debt&#xA0;and it&#x2019;s time to deal with it. When given a challenge, America has always answered the call.John F. Kennedy said &#x201C;We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard,&#xA0;because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we&#xA0;intend to win, and the others, too.&#x201D;It&#x2019;s time for courageous action to address the debt, the spending and the waste. This is our money and our future so we need to get involved and insist that the issue gets solved. It&#x2019;s time to activate American ingenuity and industriousness to change the direction we are headed.<strong>The Great American Turnaround</strong><br> We need to change the&#xA0;headlines from arguments and gridlock to the Great American Turnaround. As a nation, we&#x2019;re addicted to intriguing content like PSY&#x2019;s Gangnam Style (over 1.3 billion views on YouTube), cause-related stories like Kony 2012 (94 million views), and compelling campaigns like the LiveStrong movement (80 million bracelets sold to raise funds for cancer). Now is the time to share a story&#xA0;that gets Americans involved in solving one of the biggest problems this country has ever faced.<strong>Do you Give a Buck?</strong><br> Imagine choosing to donate $1 or more every paycheck to the &#x201C;Dollar Save Club.&#x201D; Think Kickstarter and Kiva for America&#x2014;a fund that can be used to invest in&#xA0;and build domestic projects like the national electric grid, high-speed Internet, bridges,&#xA0;roads, tunnels, airports, high-speed rail, and even people. Americans love a challenge, so rather than being passive, apathetic, sidelined victims waiting for our leaders to do something, we the people can show the rest of the world that we are capable of solving our own problems.Imagine every major retailer, credit card company and bank allowing consumers to &#x201C;Give a Buck&#x201D; when paying for groceries, for meals and so on. We&#x2019;re essentially doing it already. &#x201C;I Give a Buck&#x201D; bracelets, stickers and posters would represent involvement and resolve to solve the problem. With millions of Americans and every corporation in America participating every day, every week and every month, we could go a long way in proving that we can solve the issue, and, just as importantly, solve our disconnected attitude to the greatest challenge we face as a nation.Do you give a buck?&#xA0;<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span><em>Photo: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/vintagedept/5237569925/\" target=\"_blank\">vintagedept</a></em>"

       "content_body":"I previously had the privilege of guest lecturing at San Diego State University on innovation and brand development. I am both inspired and challenged by the wide variety of students I teach. Early this summer one MBA student stood out to me&#x2014;in fact he approached me in the car park after class and asked if we could grab a coffee. Long story short, Kevin Smoker used to be lifeguard, had his own dive instruction business, and was passionate about building a business around the water until he was struck by a car on his way home from lifeguard duty. Hospitalized and then forced to lay flat on his back for months due to damages to his inner ear, Kevin&#x2019;s doctors told him he should give up professional aspirations in and under the water. Instead of feeling defeated, Kevin decided to go back to school to get his MBA, and today he is a Product Manager at Life Technologies. After several coffees with Kevin, I realized what common sense wisdom he had, so I asked him to share some of it. Here&#x2019;s what he has to say:As many of us vacationed at the beach over the summer, there was an iconic figure standing on his or her tower, tanned skin glistening in the sun, face caked with sunscreen shining as a stoic embodiment of everything summer. But those guards are more than just blonde hair and tan skin. Unknowingly,they can be an inspiration to business leaders everywhere. The standards lifeguards learn in their first few weeks in red trunks are ones that each of us can take back to the office when finished relaxing on the beach.<strong>Scan your area and know your beach.</strong><br>The first thing that we can learn from a lifeguard is to watch everything. Lifeguards are consistently aware of their surroundings and are always paying careful attention. They use scanning patterns in which they scan their primary water area directly in front of them where most of the swimmers are. Then they scan a secondary area including the area outside the surf line and just on the shore, where experienced surfers, boaters, and waders are playing. Finally they scan their tertiary area farther out onto the horizon, up the beach, and on the boardwalk. If something is happening on their beach, they are aware of it. As guards constantly scan, they never focus on the same thing for more than a few seconds. One maxim says that if you stare at one swimmer for 30 seconds you may have missed another one struggling. Similarly in your business you might constantly watch, or be constantly vigilant of not only your immediate and active competitors, but also pay attention to what your latent competition is doing. But watching the present marketplace and currently emerging trends isn&#x2019;t enough; you need to be keenly aware of what new technologies may be on the horizon that you haven&#x2019;t noticed. Typewriter maker Smith Corona had no issues with the swimmers in the water, but missed the 100-ton cruise ship of PCs offshore that eventually crashed into their beach. Imagine your beach&#x2014;what is happening in the water? What is happening on the sand? What is happening at on the horizon? Chances are it is more than just some seagulls and seaweed.<strong>When you discover a trend on the horizon trust your instincts and investigate.</strong> <br>Lifeguards are taught &#x201C;when in doubt just go out.&#x201D; If you see something happening in the water that doesn&#x2019;t look quite right, go out and investigate it&#x2014;a swimmer seeming to have a tough time may become a rescue in a few minutes. So the best practice is to simply go into the ocean, warn them of the potential danger and ask them to move them to a better place. For all the time guards spend looking at the water, experienced guards learn to quickly recognize a gut feeling about something that doesn&#x2019;t seem quite right. Simply being aware of the a potential problem isn&#x2019;t enough; guards investigate them to assert they are clear of danger or take actions to solve for the hazard before it becomes a major problem. In business, seeing a coming trend requires you to go out and learn far more about the technology or idea and take active steps to be on top of it. Companies like Proctor and Gamble (LINK) are masters of being aware of these trends and getting out to investigate them. Through in-depth field research, P&amp;G spends hundreds of hours and millions of dollars learning new ways customers are using their products or examining novel solutions to the same problem. As a company, when you identify an emerging trend or product concern, get out of your office, swim into the market, immerse yourself, and find out firsthand.<strong>When you decide to make a rescue, take a moment to plan what the scene will look like once you get there.</strong> <br>The third and perhaps most important thing one can learn from a lifeguard is the most difficult skill that lifeguards must learn&#x2014;strategic planning. It takes experience and practice, but eventually all great lifeguards have the ability to stay cool, calm, and collected in the face of emergencies while staying focused on their plan. Before rushing into CPR or a water rescue, competent lifeguards need to stop to think, take in the whole scene, develop a plan, then proceed to the rescue based on their training and experience. On their first rescue, novice guards typically rush out to save a victim, but don&#x2019;t have a coherent plan to actually bring them back or think about what they will do if three others start struggling nearby. Corporate dilemmas are no different and all too often companies, teams, and individuals respond with gusto and rush in to solve the problem immediately without a clear vision for what the end state actually looks like. When you or your company is taking action, be sure to remember to analyze what the net result will be once you have arrived at your destination.<strong>When the moment necessitates it, take calm, controlled, and decisive action.</strong> <br>Lifeguards are trained to be leaders on the beach and when something needs to be done they act with the public&#x2019;s best interest in mind and make clear, decisive decisions to rescue those in need. For guards the worst mistake is missing a rescue, but almost as bad is seeing one and being unable to respond due to indecision. Similarly in businesses, being aware of an emerging trend and taking too long to come to a decision and act on it means you might miss the opportunity. Imagine a guard acting the way some companies approach problems: A lifeguard spots ten people struggling in a rip current. He radios the nearby headquarters and stands on the beach to have a committee meeting to decide on the best path forward, then he goes up a few levels, radios the chief, and finally comes to a decision. Although he needed a plan to save everyone, he could have taken immediate steps to assure reinforcements and started the process to affect the rescue. Look at Sony, for example. They have seemingly become seriously challenged with slow and indecisive decision-making. While they owned the market with Walkman and the Triniton, they have spent millions recently trying to establish many new arms of the company and yet they seem to have missed the mark on nearly every one. So when the next emergency pops up and the entire scene has changed in an instant, be decisive and calm. Take a brief time to plan, and then act, as it can save millions, if not billions, of dollars the same way it saves lives every day.As summer comes to an end and you return to the office, ask yourself how you can be the vigilant lifeguard of your business. Think about those red-suited rescuers when you get back to work and be ready watch everything on your beach. When you spot something out there, go out and investigate. When it looks like its time to make your move, plan for what the scene will look like when you arrive at the scene. And finally, don&#x2019;t forget your sunscreen.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"When I misbehaved as a young lad, my mother was the one who almost always reprimanded me. After lecturing me on the rights and wrongs, she&#x2019;d ask, &#x201C;Did you do that on purpose, son?&#x201D; and then hand out the punishment. My actions were almost always spontaneous episodes of teenage stupidity&#x2014;not premeditated acts of dissent.&#xA0;While I was definitely a rebellious teenager, my mother&#x2019;s inquisition always made me think about my actions, and to this day, &#x201C;Are you doing that on purpose?&#x201D; is a question I ask myself regularly about my impact on others.<strong>Purpose and people are the new frontier</strong><br>For most businesses today, the most valuable asset they manage is their people&#x2014;and employee engagement and satisfaction is a strategic imperative that every leadership team should understand and explore proactively. People who turn up to work each day, and aren&#x2019;t actively using their talents to pursue or connect to their purpose, don&#x2019;t operate at their full potential. People who find their reason for being, who uncover their purpose and connect with it passionately, become more engaged and significantly more effective at work and in life because of a clear sense of fulfillment. Helping your employees discover and define their purpose represents a significant opportunity to improve &#x201C;people&#x201D; engagement and therefore overall corporate performance.Companies that find their purpose are no different when they define or rediscover their reason for being.&#xA0;Working closely with executive teams at large corporations to reposition and refresh their brands, I encounter many who ask for our guidance and help to explore and define their purpose in the world. On the surface this sounds like vision and mission work, but when examined, it becomes deep strategic work that has the potential to impact every facet of a business. The opportunity to do business around purpose is one of the new frontiers for driving significant and meaningful change both inside and outside of a company.<strong>How is purpose different from vision?</strong><br>There has been a lot written around purpose, the role we play in the world, the reason we exist as individuals and the need for our lives to have meaning. Finding purpose is the central question we all seek to answer at a key point in our lives (whether we know it or not) and thanks to&#xA0;authors like Simon Sinek and Rick Warren (and of course my mother) there are tools that can help us find the answer. Like people who are trying to find their way, companies who are seeking to reinvigorate their business and find a relevant and compelling position for themselves must step back and answer the central question of why they exist in the world.&#xA0;Oftentimes executive teams try to answer this question by laying out a vision statement around how they see the future.A vision statement for many is aspirational; it&#x2019;s a description of what the company wants to achieve, and is not intended to be literal. Sadly the result is often not believable or totally unachievable. Whereas, a purpose statement clearly articulates the reason a company exists in the world, the role it plays (and the difference it makes) in people&#x2019;s lives, offering a clear and accurate description of the core business.<strong>Companies with a greater purpose&#xA0;</strong><br>A company must make money and add value to the community it exists to serve. But this is merely operating as a viable entity. Existing to make money does not unlock the potential contained in the power of a clear purpose. It feels like just yesterday when purpose-committed companies like <a href=\"http://www.patagonia.com/us/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Patagonia</a> and <a href=\"http://www.newmansown.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Newman&#x2019;s Own</a> were few and far between. But today successful new companies&#xA0;like <a href=\"http://www.warbyparker.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Warby Parker</a>, <a href=\"http://www.feedprojects.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FEED</a>, <a href=\"http://www.miir.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MiiR</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cleanwelltoday.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cleanwell</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehonestkitchen.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Honest Kitchen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ravenandlily.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Raven + Lily</a>, <a href=\"http://ssekodesigns.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sseko Designs</a>, <a href=\"http://www.project7.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Project 7</a> and <a href=\"http://theparadigmproject.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Paradigm Project</a> are among the many&#xA0;social enterprises that were founded with a clear purpose in mind, and are sprouting up in almost every business category, challenging the current ways of doing business and offering consumers the ability to make a broader impact through the products they purchase.<strong>Southwest flies (and profits) on purpose&#xA0;</strong><br>Purpose is not the exclusive territory of socially conscious startups. <a href=\"http://www.southwest.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Southwest Airlines</a> was built on making flying and travel accessible to more Americans. And forty years later, their reason for being is still expressed and executed strategically across every facet of their business. &#x201C;Freedom to Fly&#x201D; can be experienced by customers in&#xA0;three simple areas: low fares, lots of&#xA0;flights, and the friendliest&#xA0;service in the sky. They&#xA0;give their employees the freedom to keep fares low&#xA0;in every city they serve, and&#xA0;they are low by&#xA0;philosophy, not expediency. They provide the best customer service in the airline industry&#xA0;&#x2013; and&#xA0;call it Positively Outrageous Service. Their reason for being (their purpose) is expressed in every functional area of their business, and the difference shows in the customer experience as well as in their financial performance. They have enjoyed forty consecutive years of profits, which is unheard of in the domestic airline industry.We&#x2019;re seeing the search to clarify purpose as a growing trend among the international companies we work with, as their executives seek to understand how to play a more meaningful role in the world and improve their overall business performance. So if you sit in the C-Suite of any major corporation today, don&#x2019;t run past the question of purpose as a serious opportunity to impact your business and the people who work for you.<strong>The benefits and effects of your people doing their work on purpose<br></strong>When your company has a clear purpose, you plan with that connected purpose, mapping your strategy clearly to your reason for existing as a business and the role you play in the world. When objectives have a purpose, everyone on the team is on the same page and understands what to do and why they are doing it. If you define your purpose, plan with it in mind, and measure your actions and performance against it accordingly, you increase engagement, inspire performance and do your most rewarding and satisfying work.&#xA0; And, if in doubt, always remember what my mother said, &#x201C;Are you doing that on purpose?&#x201D;<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "principle":"THE ART OF THE START",
       "content_body":"From the time I was 16 years-old I&#x2019;ve been involved in photojournalism. Throughout my career I have had a passion for covering socioeconomic issues, particularly documenting stories of homeless individuals and others affected by what I refer to as the &#x201C;industrial dissolution&#x201D; &#x2013; the shift from an economy driven by industry and labor to one driven by technology. I have always enjoyed volunteering at homeless centers, befriending the people there, and when possible using photography to tell their stories.I recently had the pleasure of volunteering with a grassroots organization called <a href=\"https://www.sharpdressedman.org/\">Sharp Dressed Man</a>, which provides high quality suits for unemployed, often homeless men who are not able to afford appropriate business attire to reenter the workforce. The Baltimore startup was founded by a friend of mine, clothier Christopher Schafer, with the goal of providing people with a new start in life through a simple suit.<strong>In pursuit of better<br></strong>The organization partners with other outreach programs and shelters to locate men who are trying to reenter the workforce. Once a candidate is granted a job interview, he is given a referral to visit Sharp Dressed Man where he&#x2019;s fitted for a high quality suit. The suits are a combination of donations and overstocks and each is custom fit to each man through the volunteer work of experienced tailors. These men are not simply given a new suit, but an experience typically only had by the wealthy. The combination is especially powerful for a man who is trying to work his way off the street.<strong>Confidence through coats<br></strong>It is incredibly moving to watch the reactions of the men as they receive something so simple. When they walk through the door they&#x2019;re carrying enormous burdens on their shoulders, but when they look in the mirror wearing their new suits their eyes light up and they smile at themselves with a new sense of pride and dignity. They no longer see someone who lives on the street; instead they see a confident man capable of accomplishing anything.And when they arrive at their job interview they are not just well dressed, they&#x2019;re usually the best dressed man in the room. During the interview, they are no longer defined by their situation &#x2013; whether they are homeless, a recovering addict or struggling with something else that might hold them back from employment. They now appear to both the interviewer and themselves as a proud and confident individual who is a viable candidate for the job.&#xA0;<strong>Transforming hope through giving<br></strong>I had the privilege of photographing these men with their new sense of pride, confidence and personal reinvention. Because you can so vividly see the hope in the men&#x2019;s eyes when they look at their new reflection, Schafer hopes to one day set up a camera behind the mirror to capture the moment of transformation. You can see hope enter back into their life in that moment. For many homeless people, hope is difficult to recapture once lost. Oftentimes, they feel severely crippled in their ability to control their own destinies. Witnessing hope being restored is profoundly beautiful.&#xA0;<strong>Giving is getting<br></strong>Watching the transformation gives the Sharp Dressed Man volunteers a great sense of fulfillment. They know firsthand that it is so much more rewarding to give than to receive. The volunteers receive the greatest gift of all &#x2013; knowing that they have had a profound effect on the life of another human being. Such a gift is priceless, and unlike gifts of a material nature, this one can never be taken away.Inspired? You can support Sharp Dressed Man by donating your <a href=\"https://www.sharpdressedman.org/volunteer/\">time and talent</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sharpdressedman.org/donateclothes/\">your clothing</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sharpdressedman.org/donateclothes/\">hosting a clothing drive</a>, or by supporting their <a href=\"https://www.sharpdressedman.org/give-money/\">funding efforts</a>.&#xA0;<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"If you&#x2019;re a designer like me&#x2014;or someone with a stake in the design process&#x2014;I bet you believe that we create products and services based on well-informed decisions. Some of us do, but most of us don&#x2019;t.Sure, we conduct market research, identify target audiences, and follow strategy documents that seem to meet the needs of the client or the consumer. Then we develop our work based on our findings, ship it, and watch to see if people love or hate what we&#x2019;ve done.But somewhere along the way, somewhere in between the creation of the design brief, the whiteboard sketches, and the final code check-in, we realize that we may be missing something.What&#x2019;s often missing in the design process is a deeper understanding of the values of the people who use the products or services. Values are the beliefs in life that we deem important or meaningful to us. They can be external concerns like safety or community, or internal beliefs such as beauty or validation. In this new world of rapid iteration and lean processes, more often than not, we haven&#x2019;t taken the time to develop a clear understanding of the human values in play before we enter the design process.And this is a problem. A big one.But let&#x2019;s take a few steps back. In order to design for people, we need to first understand why human values are such an important part of the design process.<strong>Design Is Human-Centered</strong><br> Let&#x2019;s face it&#x2026; the design process is a complicated, jumbled mess. Even worse, methods vary wildly from designer to designer. Adding to this complexity, designers in all disciplines are cast in a precarious position of authority. Why? Because they are directly involved in the conception and production of artifacts that people use every day.Since people are the primary stakeholders of almost any designed product or service, it&#x2019;s safe to say that design is a human-centered process. And if design is truly a human-centered process, then the intent of the end product must focus on what we human beings value as important and meaningful.This means that those involved in the design process must be acutely attuned to the core values of their audience. Right? <em>Right.</em><strong>Human Values in the Design Process</strong><br> You may be thinking that this is pretty elementary stuff. And you&#x2019;re correct&#x2026; it is a fairly simple idea.But this concept is not always as easy to implement as it would seem. Identifying the values of the audience gets lost in the shuffle of the design process too often. For the context of this discussion, let&#x2019;s look at human values in three typical phases of the design process.1. Research<br> While most strategy documents and design briefs identify the target audience, create detailed user scenarios, and even go so far as to create unique personas, too many miss the deeper human component in their conclusions.&#xA0;We don&#x2019;t dive deep enough to really find out<em> why </em>our product would matter to people we want to reach.That&#x2019;s not to say design teams don&#x2019;t perform user research. In most cases, tons of analytic data is collected, hours of product testing are performed, and email inboxes are filled with qualitative feedback. But it&#x2019;s possible to go through the entire research phase and forget to distill down our findings to simple core values that our audience holds dearly.Why does it matter so much? Because the rest of the design process should follow from these initial findings. That is why it is so critical to make sure this that human values are defined correctly in this phase.2. Implementation<br> Even if human values are defined properly early on, they might be neglected for other reasons altogether.&#xA0;Designers have a tendency to misinterpret or distort the research provided to them in the interest of time or lack of clarity. But designers don&#x2019;t purposefully ignore the findings of their research teams. It can be difficult to implement principles without persistent critique and inclusion in user testing.I believe the best practice is to involve designers (and in some cases the development team) as much as possible in the research phase. Those creating the product should be able to see and hear what clicks and what doesn&#x2019;t&#x2014;straight from their audience. The more attune a designer is to the actual people using the product, the better the product will be.Once design teams understand how and why a person might perceive their product or service, they should be that much closer to rendering deliverables that are on-point. Simply put, designing <em>with</em> the audience is a better practice than designing <em>for</em> them.3. Delivery<br> Some design teams are often weighed down by the pressure of getting their product to market as fast as possible. They don&#x2019;t quite see the value of taking time to align the deeper human values to the experience. The prevailing belief in some circles is that once the product is shipped, it can then be analyzed to see how it performs. Then, adjustments can be made from the initial design to align with feedback.And while that method does have benefits in some areas of design (namely in the web and app space), not every product will fit into this model. Here are some tough questions I have to ask: How much does it cost to iterate on the product multiple times versus getting it closer to the desired product initially? If we identify the human values at stake earlier in the process, wouldn&#x2019;t we save time and resources over the long term? If we don&#x2019;t deliver a differentiated first-run experience, aren&#x2019;t we discouraging our audience from using our product altogether?I believe that if we took a step back and looked at the situation from the audience&#x2019;s perspective, we&#x2019;d find that people want a unique experience that provides some meaning to their lives. Yes, they may be impatient, but if the design doesn&#x2019;t nail this the first time, we&#x2019;ve lost their trust. The design team will spend more time and resources attempting to remedy the situation, searching to find the right &#x201C;special sauce&#x201D; that will resonate with the audience&#x2014;but it may be too late at that point.<strong>How to Define Human Values</strong><br> You may be thinking that there&#x2019;s no way to identify every value of each person. And you&#x2019;re correct again&#x2026; human values vary from person to person.However, the design process can be aided by evaluating which values are appropriate for each product. The good news is that there are some strategies that have already been developed around this topic.<strong>Value-Sensitive Design</strong><br> In the academic arena, University of Washington professors Batya Friedman, Peter Kahn, and Alan Borning have developed a very interesting approach called <a href=\"http://vsdesign.org\" target=\"_blank\">Value-Sensitive Design</a>. They&#x2019;ve identified 12 values based on moral theory, each helping to simplify the complex relationship between humans and technology.For example, privacy is something we value when shopping online. There may also be other values present in this scenario, such as trust or informed consent. Values like these can be evaluated with a three-part method: identifying values that might apply (conceptual), testing the values with the audience (empirical), and evaluating the values in relationship to the form (technical). Giving it flexibility, the scope of values included can be broadened or narrowed depending on the audience.Before dismissing it as purely &#x201C;academic research,&#x201D; consider this: it&#x2019;s not that different from typical design processes currently employed in the industry. Friedman, Kahn, and Borning used the foundations of a well-known commercial method called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_design\" target=\"_blank\">Participatory Design</a> and added the moral and ethical elements often missing. Plus, Value-Sensitive Design has its roots in online security (cookies in web browsers) and a host of other commercial applications (office environments, integrated land use, transportation, robotics, and even projects within Microsoft). Further, they&#x2019;ve developed a tool for designers called <a href=\"http://www.envisioningcards.com\" target=\"_blank\">Envisioning Cards</a> which guide the process to consider systemic issues that may be present. This is a potentially cost-saving initiative that drives holistic thinking across a product line. That seems like smart business to me.<strong>Making Meaning</strong><br> If you need more evidence of human values in the commercial arena, Nathan Shedroff has developed a value-based concept in successful branding. Shedroff is a user experience pioneer and co-author of a book entitled <a href=\"http://makingmeaning.org\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Making Meaning: How Successful Companies Deliver Meaningful Experiences</em></a> co-written with Steve Diller and Darrel Rhea. He believes that everything we design is an experience. And I believe he&#x2019;s right. Whether it&#x2019;s a film, a website, an app, or a retail environment, a design is an experience that is built to evoke meaning in people.Shedroff illustrates his concept on experience design with five concentric layers. Each layer focuses on typical values of consumers. The outer layer is about functionality (<em>Does this do what I need?</em>). Following that is a layer regarding cost (<em>Is the price worth it?</em>). Diving deeper into the circle is a layer relating to emotion (<em>How does this make me feel?</em>). Next is a layer about sense of self or identity (<em>Is this like me?</em>). And finally, at the core of the circle is the layer about meaning (<em>What do I get from this?</em>).&#xA0;If the person feels that each of these value criteria are met, then they usually are satisfied with the experience.This idea is supported by <a href=\"http://makingmeaning.org/meanings.html\" target=\"_blank\">15 core meanings</a> that Shedroff defines as important to the process. For example, the core meaning of &#x201C;accomplishment&#x201D; details achieving goals and obtaining a sense of satisfaction. He notes that brands such as American Express (luxury credit lines) and Nike (&#x201C;Just Do It&#x201D;) have tapped into this core meaning in their respective campaigns.&#xA0;By connecting the product to specific values, the brand is providing what the consumers want: something that is meaningful to them.<strong>Putting this into Practice</strong><br> I acknowledge that there is no fail-safe way to design for the values of others. But if we don&#x2019;t try to figure out what our audience deems valuable and what gives them meaning, then our product or service doesn&#x2019;t have a realistic shot of making an impact.Successful brands know how to identify and design with the values of people in mind. They make it a priority. Their research, design, and development teams are all in alignment with the core values of their users. And what&#x2019;s more is that their marketing and advertising strategy is right in line with what values their product delivers. It all syncs.With so many moving parts of an organization, I know how difficult it is to keep alignment. Even so, this idea is critical to success. I believe that human values need to be front and center of the entire design process. Once the design team has defined these values, they have to continually check their work against those values&#x2014;in design critiques, in testing, and even in code.We design for people and what they value. Let&#x2019;s put this principle into practice.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

It doesn&#x2019;t matter.<br><br><em>&#x201C;So what do you do?&#x201D;</em><br><br><em>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m a designer,&#x201D;</em> I answer.<br><br><em>&#x201C;Oh, so you arrange interiors?&#x201D;</em><br><br><em>&#x201C;Not really,&#x201D;</em> I say.<br><br><em>&#x201C;Then you program stuff with computers?&#x201D;</em><br><br>(Sigh.)<br><br>I&#x2019;m sure you know the feeling. You&#x2019;ve been asked that same question a million times yourself. And you know it would take hours to define the details of your day-to-day, your importance to the world, and how you truly break the mold of all their preconceived notions for your profession. Sometimes I go there. But most often I politely respond, &#x201C;Yeah, something like that.&#x201D;<br><br>We all deal with the &#x201C;the what.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s hard to define what you do for a living to people who may not understand. But it&#x2019;s a fair question&#x2014;and in fact, it&#x2019;s usually one of the first things I ask others. As frustrating as it may be to explain your job to others, I&#x2019;ll say this: I think it&#x2019;s even harder for us to define why we do something.<br><br><strong>The Stories in Our Roots</strong><br>I think about &#x201C;the why&#x201D; all the time. I think it can be just as interesting to find the cause of something than to observe the actual thing itself. If you think about it, understanding &#x201C;the why&#x201D; is almost like unlocking a mystery or decoding a puzzle. There&#x2019;s a sense of accomplishment, almost like a reward. You&#x2019;re discovering something deeper, something yet unexplained.<br><br>Think about &#x201C;the what&#x201D; and &#x201C;the why&#x201D; in terms of what we see and what we don&#x2019;t. Let&#x2019;s look at a plant as a metaphor. There&#x2019;s beauty in the outward appearance of the plant&#x2014;the stem, the leaves, and the bloom of a flower. But if we were to pull that plant from the ground, we would see that there exists a totally different sense of beauty. There&#x2019;s the primary root of the plant and a multitude of secondary roots, each providing a support structure for the steam, leaves, and flowers above. There&#x2019;s a story hidden in each one of those roots.<br><br>I&#x2019;d like to think the same goes for us. We all have roots that provide our stories. We all have reasons why we&#x2019;re in the place that we&#x2019;re in and why we do what we do. Our chosen occupation or current position may not be a perfect reflection of everything we value. But our job does say something about our past, our present, and maybe even our future.<br><br><strong>The Past</strong><br>I started asking myself &#x201C;the why&#x201D; during the final months of my undergraduate Art and Design program and a couple things occurred to me during this exploration. I realized that I enjoyed being in a creative role that allowed me to ideate. I also liked that design was a strategic endeavor that enabled me to bring a sense of order to incomplete content. Thinking through a problem and crafting a response was something that seemed to resonate with my personality and skill-set.<br><br>These reasons why I became a designer are still valid for me today, but there have been times when I became a little disillusioned with what I was designing. As we all know, situations at our place of work can cause some unrest. It&#x2019;s human nature to feel frustrated, tired, and burnt out at times. As a result, I decided that I needed a bit of a change, and for me, that was getting my Master of Design degree.<br><br>I won&#x2019;t go into all of the details of my graduate school experience but one important moment stands out in regards to &#x201C;the why.&#x201D; At the end of a particularly long day, I received a text message from a good friend. She explained that she was just ending another stressful 12-hour session at her marketing firm. I complained that my thesis project was in shambles and I hadn&#x2019;t been sleeping well.<br><br><em>&#x201C;Why do we do this to ourselves?&#x201D;</em> she asked.<br><br>I paused, thought for a moment, and then it hit me.<br><br><em>&#x201C;Why? Because passion matters,&#x201D;</em> I replied.<br><br>There was no better explanation for me. I knew that I had taken on this new challenge because I deeply cared about the practice of design. The initial reasons I became a designer are still a part of my story, but I discovered that passion is my primary root. I am fueled by the opportunity to create meaningful experiences. I&#x2019;m devoted to it. So much so in fact, that the phrase &#x201C;passion matters&#x201D; has become something of a mantra for me now&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a reminder of why I do what I do.<br><br><strong>The Present</strong><br>It would be untrue if I said that ever since that conversation with my friend, my days as a designer have been easy. They haven&#x2019;t been&#x2014;and they never will be. I have good days and bad days, great projects and no-so-great projects. I&#x2019;m sure some of you can relate. But every time I question myself or my work, I always come back to that primary root: my passion for design.<br><br>To me, passion means that you care. And caring means that you&#x2019;ll do your best work. And your best work will make a difference (even if you don&#x2019;t realize it at the time). Obviously, this doesn&#x2019;t mean that every project will save the planet. It doesn&#x2019;t mean that every task will have a meaningful component to it. But do I know there are moments where you will have the opportunity to feel particularly proud of your work because it made a difference to someone else. And that matters.<br><br>You might be thinking that passion is well and good, but your current position doesn&#x2019;t allow you to be passionate. Well, good news: you don&#x2019;t have to have the same &#x201C;why&#x201D; to do your job. I&#x2019;ve had plenty of other jobs that didn&#x2019;t require passion. Your &#x201C;why&#x201D; might be because you have a sense of responsibility to your country. Or maybe you just need to provide financially for you and your family. That is reason enough.<br><br><strong>The Future</strong><br>I&#x2019;m not sure what direction my career will take next. Maybe you don&#x2019;t either. But I do know that I will take a look back before I take a step forward. I&#x2019;ll remind myself of the roots underneath the surface. I know that I do my best work when I&#x2019;m truly passionate. I&#x2019;ll use that knowledge as a guide for the next challenge I take on.<br><br>I urge you to think about &#x201C;the why&#x201D; for yourself. You don&#x2019;t need to have the best answer to the question&#x2014;it&#x2019;s enough that you have an answer. Because knowing why you do something is just as important as knowing what you do.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"When I misbehaved as a young lad, my mother was the one who almost always reprimanded me. After lecturing me on the rights and wrongs, she&#x2019;d ask, <em>&#x201C;Did you do that on purpose, son?&#x201D; </em>and then hand out the punishment. My actions were almost always spontaneous episodes of teenage stupidity&#x2014;not premeditated acts of dissent.&#xA0;While I was definitely a rebellious teenager, my mother&#x2019;s inquisition always made me think about my actions, and to this day, <em>&#x201C;Are you doing that on purpose?&#x201D;</em> is a question I ask myself regularly about my impact on others.<strong>Purpose and people are the new frontier.</strong><br>For most businesses today, the most valuable asset they manage is their people&#x2014;and employee engagement and satisfaction are strategic imperatives that every leadership team should understand. People who turn up to work each day and aren&#x2019;t actively using their talents to pursue or connect to their purpose don&#x2019;t operate at their full potential. People who find their reason for being, who uncover their purpose and connect with it passionately, become more engaged and significantly more effective at work and in life because of a clear sense of fulfillment. Helping your employees discover and define their purpose represents a significant opportunity to improve &#x201C;people&#x201D; engagement and, therefore, overall business performance.Companies that find their purpose are no different when they define or rediscover their reason for being.&#xA0;Working closely with executive teams at large corporations to reposition and refresh their brands, we encounter many who ask for our guidance to explore and define their purpose. This is not just vision and mission work, it is deep strategic work that can impact every facet of a business, both inside and outside of a company.<strong>How is purpose different from vision?</strong><br>There has been a lot written around purpose, the role we play in the world, the reason we exist and the need for our lives to have meaning. Finding purpose is the central question we all seek to answer at a key point in our lives. Like people trying to find their way, companies seeking to reinvigorate their business and find a relevant and compelling position must step back and answer the central question of why they exist in the world.&#xA0;Oftentimes executive teams try to answer this question by laying out a vision statement around how they see the future.A vision statement for many is aspirational; it&#x2019;s a description of what the company wants to achieve and is not intended to be literal. Whereas, a purpose statement clearly articulates the reason a company exists in the world, the role it plays, offering a clear and accurate description of the core business.<strong>Companies with a greater purpose.&#xA0;</strong><br>It feels like just yesterday when purpose-driven companies like <a href=\"http://www.newmansown.com/\">Newman&#x2019;s Own</a>&#xA0;and <a href=\"http://www.patagonia.com/us/home\">Patagonia</a> were few and far between. Today, they are sprouting up in almost every business category, and challenging the current ways of doing business.Chobani&#x2019;s purpose is to &#x201C;make universal wellness happen sooner&#x2026; totally and deeply committed to playing an active role in transforming our food system for the betterment of our planet, our people and our communities&#x201D;. And for twelve years this purpose has been expressed and executed strategically across every facet of their business.<strong>&#x201C;The Chobani Way&#x201D;</strong> is the brand&#x2019;s commitment to the highest standards for lawful, honest, and ethical conduct in all business dealings. This commitment is reflected in everything that it does&#x2014;from its purpose-driven business decisions, to philanthropic efforts and the way that employees and partners are treated. Consistent with Chobani&#x2019;s commitment to provide Better food for more people; the brand follows the highest standards for lawful, honest, and ethical conduct in all business dealings ensuring its products are produced and manufactured with ingredients and materials sourced from suppliers that are socially and ethically responsible.<strong>Paving a path on purpose.</strong>The Chobani brand is also helping small companies challenge the food industry, improve broken systems, and make an impact through their <a href=\"https://chobaniincubator.com/\">Chobani Food Incubator</a>. Hamdi Ulukaya launched the<a href=\"https://chobaniincubator.com/\"> Incubator</a> in 2016 with the intention of helping companies take on broken food systems to carry out their goal of bringing better food to more people. In addition to investment, the Incubator gives startups access to a network of experts to scale up operations and achieve significant growth.Chobani&#x2019;s reason for being (their purpose) is expressed in every functional area of their business, and the difference shows in every metric of business performance.<strong>The benefits and effects of leading on purpose.</strong><strong><br></strong>Leaders we work with are seeking to understand how their brands play a more meaningful role in the world and how to improve their overall business performance. If you sit on the C-Suite of any major corporation today, don&#x2019;t run past the question of purpose as a serious opportunity to impact your business and the people you serve.When your company has a clear purpose, you plan with that connected purpose, mapping your strategy clearly to your reason for being as a business and the role you play in the world. When objectives have a purpose, and are clearly communicated, everyone on the team is on the same page and understands what to do and why they are doing it. If you define your purpose, plan with it in mind, and measure your actions and performance against it, you increase engagement, inspire and fuel performance and do your most rewarding and satisfying work.&#xA0;And, if in doubt, always remember what my mum said, <em>&#x201C;Are you doing that on purpose?&#x201D;</em>.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"We keep each of our monthly principles present in our minds as we design our days, setting them into practice, using them to help guide our actions, reactions and behaviors.We&#x2019;re long-time fans of the Southwest brand, their principles and the way they lead. On a recent Southwest flight, we read a piece by the brand&#x2019;s Editorial Director, Jay Heinrichs that sparked our interest. Heinrichs discusses the meaning of the word &#x201C;Spirit&#x201D; and how we can all inject more of it into our daily lives.During a rare cocktail hour, he wrote the following:&#x201C;As I raised my glass to my wife, made me wonder: Why does the same word that denotes an alcoholic beverage also get used to describe a mood, a team&#x2019;s character, a ghost, a theft (spirited away), a journey (ditto), and the breath of God (Holy Spirit)?Being an unabashed geek I went straight to that source of deep wisdom, the Oxford English Dictionary. There, I learned the word comes from the Latin meaning &#x201C;breath&#x201D;. The same Latin gives us &#x201C;inspiration&#x201D;; the ancients believed you got it by inhaling the breath of the muses.Over the ages, &#x201C;spirit&#x201D; came to mean the soul or essence, the very air of a thing. Clever writers put the word to use for distilled substances; distillation, after all, gets down to the essence of things. The point, or essence of all this is that the most spirited moment of a cocktail house&#x2014;in a bar or at home, with a friend or lover or book&#x2014;comes right after you give a quiet &#x201C;cheers&#x201D; or &#x201C;L&#x2019;chaim&#x201D; and raise the glass. That little ceremony, the anticipation, is the first breath of something.Which makes me wonder further: While alcohol is the water of life, can you inhale that spirit without the alcohol? Can you take a breath of your own, welcome the muses, say &#x201C;Here&#x2019;s to life,&#x201D; and get the same effect? In other words, can you distill that moment and use it whenever you want? Give it a try. That&#x2019;s the spirit!&#x201D;&#xA0;<em>Read more by<a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/author/bulldog-drummond#filters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Bulldog Drummond</a>.</em><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

The place is legendary and so is its founder, Aaron Franklin, who has been serving up what many argue is the best BBQ in the world since 2009. You may have also seen his book, watched his online videos or caught him on the TV talk show circuit.&#xA0;Franklin was one of nine stops on a three-day Texas BBQ tour I recently embarked on. My friend and I flew out of LAX with massive appetites and flew back three days later with a horrible case of meat sweats. It was worth every bite&#x2014;and resulted in a key marketing lesson along the way.As much as I loved that deliciously smoked meat, this story is not about the BBQ, it&#x2019;s about a unique little coffee shop I found along the way.&#xA0;<strong>Follow the signs<br></strong>The first attraction was a door with a tiny sign outside that simply said &#x201C;Coffee&#x201D;. I&#x2019;m one of those rare people who don&#x2019;t drink coffee&#x2014;but I do enjoy a good conversation&#x2014;and I got one.Sterling was the owner&#x2019;s name&#x2014;a sheet metal man who makes motorcycles. It turns out he has also made two of Franklin&#x2019;s smokers. But it was his love for coffee that influenced him to build a coffee shop. Welcome to <a href=\"http://flattrackcoffee.com/\">Flat Track Coffee</a>, a small, authentic shop in Austin that roasts their own coffee beans, has an <a href=\"https://squareup.com/market/flattrack-coffee\">online merchandise store</a> and a pop-up coffee service&#x2014;and their <a href=\"http://flattrackcoffee.tumblr.com\">tumblr</a> is pretty awesome too.<strong>Passion propels purpose and purpose propels passion<br></strong>Two things were clear the moment I started chatting with Sterling:Sterling is a man who simply applies his skills&#x2014;true skills&#x2014;in inspired ways based on what he wants to accomplish. He&#x2019;s a reminder of the simple fact that if we focus on mastering a skill and treat people kindly along the way, we can succeed at almost anything.People like Sterling treat their professional lives in the same way they want to be treated. They begin by listening to their <em>professional selves</em>. Rather than letting their careers stay on autopilot, they take action. For Sterling and others like him, that action means starting their own business.How are you managing your career and your professional self? Are you listening to your true skills or are you following a path you assume others want you to follow? While a lot of folks prefer the structure of a 9&#x2013;5 job, don&#x2019;t lose sight of the fact that your skills and passions can be applied to a successful career. Sterling&#x2019;s story makes me determined to do just that.&#xA0;More&#xA0;Austin adventures and lessons highlighted <a href=\"https://medium.com/@ReasonableBP/10-marketing-lessons-from-9-insane-texas-bbq-meals-in-3-days-b7b8d5fa2ae2\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.&#xA0;<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span><em>Photo: <a href=\"http://instagram.com/texaspatrick\" target=\"_blank\">Patrick Meredith</a></em>"

Executives often pay little attention to annual research presentations (that cost millions of dollars a year) and often don&#x2019;t act on the information they&#x2019;re given.&#xA0;They operate from significant misconceptions, dated information, personal bias and long-held myths about consumers. This big disconnect can lead to poorly informed strategic planning, misfires on product development and investment allocation. Executive team members can benefit significantly in their individual functional areas by putting their consumers first and getting to know them in a deeper and more dimensional way.<strong>1. Move research from ignored to inspired<br></strong>Elevate the importance of research and ensure it is a business intelligence function that informs all areas of your business. Ban PowerPoint and insist on dynamic and interactive conversations rather than presentations. &#xA0;Insist that content for presentations are informative,&#xA0;inspiring,&#xA0;engaging and action-oriented with insights, implications and ideas that can fuel decision-making.<strong>2. Move&#xA0;research&#xA0;from analytical to directional <br></strong>Research is often overlooked or quickly forgotten because the presentations are data-driven and dry. Research always tells a story so insist that all forms of research are delivered with data-driven insights presented with the clear implications and provocative&#xA0;questions to inspire new thinking.<strong>3. Move from research that only illustrates statistics to stories that profile real people <br></strong>Bring your consumer to life in a way that people can understand and relate to. Insist that deep personifications of each of your consumers are created to show them as real people, with&#xA0;all facets of their lives clearly illustrated to help connect your company to the way your consumers live their lives.<strong>4. Move&#xA0;from static to dynamic research<br></strong>With amazing research design, technology and a clear directional brief, research should be dynamic and inspiring. Ensure you have an active portfolio of research methodologies that provide you with regular and directionally informative updates about the needs, wants, opinions, behaviors, habits and concerns of the people who buy your products and services and the trends that impact the world they live in.<strong>5.&#xA0;Research that moves from data to&#xA0;business intelligence <br></strong>Develop a dashboard model that connects all of your data so it tells a story and becomes a predictive tool that models scenarios for business performance, business decisions and strategy development. The model should connect&#xA0;sales and traffic performance data, category, economic, environmental, financial and emotional indicators that are combined to help you understand the directional changes of consumers.&#xA0;<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span><em>Photo: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/marcwathieu/2945801322\" target=\"_blank\">Marc Wathieu</a></em>"

       "content_body":"From the moment we are born, we begin to learn. Our brain soaks up as much information as it possibly can about our environment, and how to best succeed in the world around us. During our first few years we learn vital life skills such as walking and talking. When we enter preschool we practice playing and interacting with others, and we learn how to adjust to a more structured environment. Once we enter elementary school we establish more concrete academic objectives like learning how to read and write, and how to add and subtract. In middle school and high school we move beyond the basics and into more complex realms of thinking, with a more challenging workload. And, by the time we enter university we are expected to specialize in a particular area relevant to our future career and attain a sense of mastery in this chosen field.Regardless of the grade or age, school is devoted to learning. It&#x2019;s meant to challenge us more each year&#x2014;and perhaps most importantly, it&#x2019;s supposed to teach us how to learn. As a third year university student, I&#x2019;ve spent the past seventeen years of my life in school, mastering the skills to succeed in an academic atmosphere. At this point, school is in many ways my comfort zone. After spending such a long time in this environment, I have a firm grasp on what is required of me. I know that school demands hard work, but I have enough experience to have achieved a sense of confidence in my capabilities.However, this semester I&#x2019;ve been pushed far out of my comfort zone. My university&#x2019;s philosophy is &#x201C;learn by doing&#x201D;. This means that as undergrads at Cal Poly, we receive experience applying our knowledge to real life situations. This philosophy, while certainly valuable, is a challenge. It completely changes the school dynamic by taking students out of the classroom and asking them to apply their learned-knowledge in a true setting.Learning by doing requires flexibility, adaptability and being ready to accept the possibility that a &#x201C;right answer&#x201D; may not exist when applying learning to real life. It means that there is a significant amount of responsibility involved, and a far greater potential&#x2014;if not a guarantee&#x2014;of failure at some point or in some capacity.This new approach to schoolwork has been a challenge that I initially resented. But, what I&#x2019;m discovering as this term progresses is that this new challenge is both more frustrating and more rewarding. While I&#x2019;m being pushed to work harder and differently, my successes are far more satisfying. Recognizing areas that need improvement forces me to workharder. I&#x2019;ve abandoned complacency and am watching myself grow. And the result is that I&#x2019;m a stronger student, a better learner, and a more developed individual. The most valuable lesson that I&#x2019;ve learned from school is <em>how</em> to learn.The most important thing that I will take away from my years of education is that there is value in being challenged. While it&#x2019;s important to achieve a sense of mastery in our lives, it&#x2019;s also important to continue to push ourselves. Being forced out of our comfort zones results inlearning far more than sticking only to what we know. Overcoming challenges builds confidence, allows us to expand our skills and our knowledge, and ultimately makes us stronger&#x2014;even if at first it seems to break us down.<strong>Four Pieces of Uncommon Sense to Carry On Learning:</strong><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

Can you think of an industry that uses almost the identical methods of production they did 100 years ago, one that hasn&#x2019;t undergone radical industrialization, innovation, or significant transformation?How about the American classroom? Our method of teaching hasn&#x2019;t radically changed over the past century. It&#x2019;s stuck, it&#x2019;s dated, and it&#x2019;s in need of radical transformation. While there are bright spots in the private school system, the public education system&#x2014;where the vast majority of our children are being taught, guided, and motivated&#x2014;is a dated, bloated, inefficient, bureaucratic dinosaur. It lost sight and understanding of its consumer a long, long time ago.Education is in large part the foundation from which our culture is built, and it should be the breeding ground for brilliance, optimism, and new thinking. I have an area of interest in human development, and specifically in children&#x2019;s education, so meeting the brilliant Sir Ken Robinson last year was like a Stones fanatic meeting Mick Jagger. The author of <em><span><a href=\"http://sirkenrobinson.com/skr/the-element\" target=\"_blank\">The Element</a></span>&#xA0;</em>and <em><span><a href=\"http://sirkenrobinson.com/skr/out-of-our-minds\" target=\"_blank\">Out of Our Minds</a></span></em> has a compelling, common sense perspective on what&#x2019;s wrong with the education system. He offers insights into the human potential and frames the implications of ignoring the problem.Nations that formerly ranked far below the U.S. in terms of standard of living are racing ahead of us to educate their next generation so they can overcome their cycle of poverty (China, India, etc.), while first-world nations (Finland, Canada, South Korea) are greatly outpacing the U.S. in terms of educational achievement. Our systemic failure to educate and prepare all children to become engaged, productive citizens of the 21st century threatens the very fabric of our democracy. Children who do not graduate from college (let alone high school) face dim prospects at best, and at worst, a lifetime of crime, poverty, or both.This is not new news, but it&#x2019;s being drowned out by every other broken system crying out for help and transformation, and it&#x2019;s being ignored because it&#x2019;s complicated. This is why we must act and act now. I have hope for when organizations like <a href=\"http://www.ideo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">IDEO</a>, <span><a href=\"http://www.fuseproject.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fuseproject</a></span>, <span><a href=\"http://www.khanacademy.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The Khan Academy</a></span>, and <a href=\"http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Pages/home.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a> get involved, and I&#x2019;m inspired when prolific authors like Seth Godin stand up and fuel the debate, &#x201C;What should we do about education?&#x201D;When I met Sajan George, the founder of <span><a href=\"http://www.matchbooklearning.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Matchbook Learning</a></span>, at a conference recently for social entrepreneurs and listened to this courageous man&#x2019;s story of conviction and common sense, he filled me with hope. I promised to do all I could to share his story of transformation and his quest to change a broken system. Here is our conversation.<strong>SHAWN PARR: What made you jump from the security of an amazing career at the start of the recession?<br></strong>SAJAN GEORGE: I left a position as managing director and head of education practice at preeminent international corporate turnaround firm Alvarez &amp; Marsal to start Matchbook Learning. While at A&amp;M, I had a front seat to some of the most amazing turnaround assignments in K-12 public education&#x2019;&#x2014;restructuring the entire school systems of cities like New York, New Orleans, Washington, St. Louis, and Detroit. I left this work not because it wasn&#x2019;t impactful&#x2014;it was&#x2014;but because the nature of that work was very top-down, driven typically behind a powerful and courageous political leader. This top-down type of reform is difficult to sustain (always a political election cycle away from being halted) and scale (these kind of courageous leaders to do our work behind are a rare commodity). I started Matchbook Learning because I saw a unique opportunity with blended learning to create a model of school reform from the bottom up that is both scalable and sustainable&#x2014;something our country desperately needs.<strong>How did Matchbook come into being?<br></strong>It started with a hypothesis: that online learning had the potential to revolutionize public education by the nature of leveraging technology to customize both content and experience for each individual student. This radical customizing technology has disrupted entire industries from books (Amazon) to music (iTunes) to newspapers (Google) to social networks (Facebook). Education is one of the last industries to succumb.However, most of technology&#x2019;s forays into public education are happening at the fringes even still. Students accessing it for supplemental learning, advanced AP classes, dropout credit recovery, home schooling, etc.There&#x2019;s a missing opportunity to bring this technology into mainstream public education&#x2014;directly to students in physical schools at the bottom end of the economic and academic spectrum. The Federal Department of Education has put out stimulus funds over the next four years for turnaround school solution providers like Matchbook Learning to turn around the bottom 5% of schools in our nation. This represents an unusual window of opportunity both in timing, funding, and momentum. Matchbook Learning was launched to seize this convergence of technology, funding, and opportunity.<strong>What does Matchbook do?<br></strong>We take over existing K-12 public schools that are in the bottom 5% of the country performance-wise (typically urban, poor, minority neighborhoods) and manage these schools day-to-day, turning around their academic performance by creating a blended model of school wherein every student receives a Netbook, online curricula, and a personalized path to learning. We train teachers in these classrooms on how to use the data to personalize instruction. This training is daily, in-the-classroom, and helps teachers review, understand, and ultimately act on the stream of real-time data they are receiving on their Netbook about how each student is learning, and helping them see where and when they can augment a student&#x2019;s learning with their own instruction, guidance, and intervention. We call it a blended school because it blends the best of a traditional school (teacher-student engagement and instruction, peer-to-peer learning and socialization, music, drama, sports, home room classrooms, etc.) with the best of virtual school (real-time data, feedback, personalized content, multimedia platforms, pacing consistent with a student&#x2019;s progress and capability, and predictability of outcomes).We manage these schools for a three- to four-year contract period, at the conclusion of which the turned around school returns to its District or State. We do not wish to manage these schools in perpetuity the way charter schools do, but rather hope and intend to transfer the capacity we build back to the school, community, and school district so it stays where it belongs and the system begins to reform.<strong>What problem are you trying to solve?<br></strong>Children born in the bottom income quartile in the U.S. have just a 9% chance of achieving a college degree by age 25. These bottom income quartile children (and by default, their parents and communities) are trapped inside chronically failing schools, projected to reach almost 20,000 schools by 2014. I started Matchbook Learning because our country lacks a sustainable, scalable solution for turning around our underperforming public schools.<strong>What business are you in?<br></strong>Turning around our nation&#x2019;s underperforming public schools.<strong>Tell me how this is supposed to work.<br></strong>The research shows that an effective teacher is the single most important determinant of a child&#x2019;s academic success. However, effective teachers are a rare commodity in general, and even rarer still in neighborhoods of poverty. No sustainable, scalable means of producing and retaining effective teachers has existed until now. Today we can create &#x201C;blended classrooms&#x201D;&#x2014;classrooms that blend the best of customized learning via technology that delivers online curriculum to individual students and their individual needs with the best of traditional instruction that leverages a physical teacher&#x2019;s passion, presence, judgment, and intuition. The online curriculum can track, monitor, and adjust learning paths for each student, providing real-time feedback to the teacher on where and how to intervene with struggling students, as well as students that are progressing. This frees the teacher up to coach, facilitate, and engage students in smaller groups. This combined or blended approach with proper coaching, implementation, and leadership can create a highly effective teacher in every classroom.We partner with content (i.e. curriculum) providers that meet the State and National Standards as well as our own standards. We also partner with hardware providers consistent with a particular School District&#x2019;s IT policy. While there is an emerging landscape of numerous software (digital curriculum) and hardware (i.e. tablets, Netbooks, etc.) providers, we don&#x2019;t feel that any one vendor has an offering clearly superior to everyone else.Once we select the right software and hardware for the particular school and students we will be serving, we focus most of our efforts on:The blended model design includes not only hardware and software, but also recruiting and training staff, optimizing class schedules, creating culture, developing feedback loops, and prototyping opportunities with the real-time data. When combined with successful implementation through on-site, full-time daily management and coaching, this can be considered the Matchbook Learning product.<strong>Give me an example of the most transformational story/moment you&#x2019;ve seen when implementing the program.<br></strong>It was the first day of school in our Detroit pilot this past September: We handed out<br> Netbooks to each student, providing each of them with their own log-in usernames and passwords. It was symbolic in how it ushered these students into a new era of learning&#x2014;one that is personalized both for the teacher and the student. The wide-eyed stares, joyful smiles, and sheer giddiness in the room was tangible&#x2014;visible signs that this kind of education reform is different from every other kind of reform that has preceded it. Ask the average student what the past impact has been of reform initiatives such as new textbooks, new teacher training, lower or higher class sizes, or new standards, and they will shrug their shoulders and perhaps yawn at the question. Teachers will probably respond somewhat the same but perhaps with a greater degree of frustration upon the impact, or lack thereof, of such failed attempts. However, ask our students what the impact of a blended model has had on their daily life, or better yet, see what it did on that first day of school, and you get a completely different response.<strong>Give me an example of one life changed as a result.<br></strong>Public schools have the potential to transform the lives of students, teachers, parents, and the community by creating a beacon for an entire city of what is possible when we enable children to dream and provide them pathways for achieving those dreams.We only launched our blended turnaround model just over five months ago, but we are already seeing signs of life-changing transformations as a result. In a city like Detroit, enrollment is shrinking: Even our school, as recently as four years ago, had an enrollment of 1,000 students. We started the year below 200 students in our blended pilot and it has steadily grown to over 215, bucking the citywide trend. We have stories of one parent with two children enrolled in our school who refused to pull them out when she got a job across town. Those two children take two city buses just to continue attending our school. We had over 200 parents attend our first Parent Night. We&#x2019;ve seen evidence of students logging in during the evenings and weekends to continue learning online without being asked to do so. We had students actually complain when we had a Christmas assembly that was cutting into their blended classroom instructional time. I&#x2019;ve had parents tell me in the hallway, &#x201C;Thank you for what you are doing in our school.&#x201D;<strong>What&#x2019;s been the hardest part of starting Matchbook Learning?<br></strong>Convincing people outside of these communities that what we are doing is not only possible, but completely probable with the right vision, leadership, and conditions. There&#x2019;s a high degree of skepticism with anything new, particularly in education that challenges the traditional axioms of how to create effective schools in neighborhoods of poverty (i.e. close the school, start from scratch, lower class size, fire teachers, etc.).<strong>What&#x2019;s been the most rewarding part of Matchbook Learning?<br></strong>Watching children and their expressions when they realize they have a personalized learning path with real-time feedback on their progress. Watching the proverbial light bulb go off in their minds and faces when they realize that their time is now, and nothing but themselves can stop them when the vast array of our world&#x2019;s information and knowledge is but a few keystrokes away.<strong>What advice would you give to anyone wanting to start a new business in education?<br></strong>Understand the problem you are trying to solve. Diagnose the root cause(s) of the problem. Be patient and develop a vision for a solution that scales to the breadth of the problem you are trying to solve. Leverage conditions that enable you to pilot, launch, and scale your vision.Note: Matchbook Learning is leveraging a unique set of turnaround conditions over the next four years wherein the Federal Government is offering radical turnaround solution providers up to $2M per year, for up to four years, including operating autonomy and flexibility to turn around our nation&#x2019;s bottom 5% of schools.<strong>Do you have a long-term vision?<br></strong>Matchbook Learning is starting at the very bottom&#x2014;the bottom 5% of public schools because:Because we are willing to &#x201C;give back&#x201D; to the school at the end of four years, we think states and school districts will be receptive to this kind of model. Since these schools will remain public schools (no name change to Matchbook Learning; they remain in their local neighborhoods serving the same kids and not replacing teachers, but improving the ability of teachers), we believe they will not be viewed as competition by unions or school boards. The stakeholders become partners with us in scaling our model. This enables our solution to scale. Secondly, as students and parents become enamored with a 21st-century way of teaching and learning that finally &#x201C;gets&#x201D; their kids and meets them where they are academically speaking, they will never want to go back to the old traditional way of teaching and learning (a single textbook, teacher, and blackboard for 30 students in a classroom). This enables our solution to sustain itself.This is the vision for our scalable and sustainable solution for public education reform. As a nonprofit turnaround management school organization&#x2014;one that turns around and then gives back the school after four years&#x2014;we can have tremendous influence operating just a handful of schools at any given time. Every year there would theoretically be new failing schools coming on board while turned-around schools return, which in turn could influence an entire state over a five-year period. We can create enough proof points in a given state (or two at the bottom of the spectrum), all the while having them remain local public schools. We have an influence on an entire state and in turn, other receptive states, by building and transferring capacity back to the customers we are serving.<strong>Where do you see Matchbook Learning in five years?<br></strong>In at least two different states, having created powerful proof points of what is possible in school turnarounds with our bottom 5% of schools, and ushering in, along with others, the future of education.<strong>Who else is helping to transform the school system?<br></strong>Matchbook Learning is not the first, the best, or the last to help transform the system of public education. There&#x2019;s a growing movement of students, parents, teachers, principals, superintendents, and government officials that are appalled at the lack of effectiveness of our nation&#x2019;s public education system, particularly for children of poverty and color.Students on their own are taking courses online even if their local school does not offer them. Teachers are using social learning platforms like <a href=\"http://about.edmodo.com/\">EdModo</a> to connect, create, and disseminate their own digital content for learning. Government leaders like Chris Barbic (Tennessee&#x2019;s achievement school district superintendent) and former NYC Chancellor Joel Klein are forging powerful visions of what systemic education reform looks like. Entrepreneurs like Sal Khan are offering students virtual lessons for free. Venture philanthropists like our funder, <a href=\"http://www.newschools.org/\">New Schools Venture Fund</a>, are taking risks and betting on the next generation of education entrepreneurial organizations to positively disrupt the K-12 public education system. Foundations like The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation are funding important research that help incubate the next generation of learning tools, apps, etc.<strong>Was there ever a moment you thought you&#x2019;d fail?<br></strong>Yes. In February 2011, a couple of weeks after leaving Alvarez &amp; Marsal and trying to figure how and what to launch, or what to even call this venture, I woke up late one morning. The house was quiet, as my wife had left to drop off our three children at school. I realized that I had no appointments, calls, or scheduled meetings that day. In other words, I had no real reason to get up. A sense of fear came over me. What am I doing? I had left a great career in the midst of arguably the deepest recession in our country with a family of five to care for, and no business plan, no funding and just a vision in my head&#x2014;a concept. I thought to myself, &#x201C;I am the stupidest man on the Earth.&#x201D; Two questions came to mind quickly: &#x201C;God, do you love me?&#x201D; and &#x201C;God, is it okay if I fail?&#x201D; While no audible voice answered, I deeply sensed the answers to be yes.After that I was good, and have been good since. We launched our first blended pilot school in Detroit in August 2011. We had received a late notice that the contract would happen and had only three weeks to hire, structure, and get our blended solution in place. It was stressful trying to get the right Program Director hired (we found a great option in Dr. Susan Claiborne), making sure my subcontract vendor providing the technology piece didn&#x2019;t walk (they got nervous and almost did), and getting the school&#x2019;s leadership and faculty ready to embrace this radical approach to schooling (it took a few months but we got through the hump and they are strong advocates for this new kind of blended school).<strong>If you can ask for one thing for Matchbook Learning what would it be?<br></strong>That stakeholders in a particular state&#x2014;state and local superintendents, philanthropic funders, principals, teachers, parents, and students&#x2014;who collectively embrace a vision of customized education and personalized learning can come together to launch, implement, and successfully scale Matchbook Learning&#x2019;s blended model.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"I remember returning from a trend trip to the United Kingdom in the early 1990&#x2032;s and flagging the emergence of the organic food movement hitting mainstream grocery stores. Admittedly, England wasn&#x2019;t known for its food back then, but the likes of Duchy Originals, Pret A Manger, Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer were leading the charge for more nutritious consumer options. Fast-forward to the present day, and America is finally catching on to the importance of product ingredients and origins.&#xA0;There is no doubt that we are witnessing the beginning of a dynamic food revolution in the United States. Major food companies are turning to artisanal and organic startups for inspiration, and retail grocers are being forced to change the way they think. With Whole Foods and Sprouts continuing their expansion, WalMart and Target embracing new formats, and Amazon Fresh entering the scene, service and innovation are likely to accelerate.Over the past few years we&#x2019;ve been very fortunate to work on a range of food-related engagements and projects, and as a result understand the complexities that surround ingredient, agricultural, distribution and supply chain issues. While working with companies like Kashi, Annie&#x2019;s, Plum Organics, The Honest Kitchen and Bolthouse Farms, we understand how progressive food companies are thinking about the role more nutritious, whole foods play in the marketplace. While the food movement is gaining momentum, it might surprise you to learn that food production is actually declining as our planet&#x2019;s population is exploding. And, while there are plenty of startups innovating and inspiring new types of food, we also need to think differently about how we grow, transport and store our food.Food is a $3 Trillion industry worldwide, but has evolved very slowly relative to other sectors like medicine, communication and transportation. Traditional farming hasn&#x2019;t experienced much innovation, it is still very much like it was when it was developed in ancient Sumeria &#x2014;dig&#xA0;a hole, plant a seed and pump water into a field or pray for rain.<strong>Meet a radical new style of farmer&#xA0;</strong><br> I met Steve Fambro last year and he&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;d call a next-century thinker. He&#x2019;s a humble, understated man, who inspires an instant sense of confidence. He&#x2019;s your quintessential geek engineer, but with a very evident artistic-poetic side. Steve is the founder of <a href=\"http://www.famgro.com/\">Famgro</a>, a new type of farm. Not so long ago he was in the checkout line of his local natural grocer, Jimbo&#x2019;s, and as the cashier was scanning his produce he asked himself why organic is so important (to avoid pesticides and GMO&#x2019;s) and so expensive? It was the second question that sent him down the rabbit hole discovering that labor is the largest cost behind organic farming. Steve figured that if he and his team could leverage their lab automation experience they might be able to&#xA0;build a farming platform that requires much less labor than traditional farming. By doing so, he believed he could lower the fundamental cost structure of organic food&#xA0;and make it affordable to everyone, not just the affluent few.<strong><a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Farming_2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5087\" title=\"Farming_2\" src=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Farming_2.jpg\" alt width=\"415\" height=\"263\"></a></strong><strong>A radically new style of farm</strong><br> Famgro grows food in places where it otherwise couldn&#x2019;t be grown, or where there is a need for fresh, local food. They offer an amazing solution: enabling food production where it can&#x2019;t exist because of resource constraints. Whether it&#x2019;s availability of land, water, favorable weather, light, or labor, they enable food production by drastically reducing the need for those variables. Using the same environmental footprint as a Prius, Famgro can grow almost as much food in one year as a full acre of farmland. While there are greenhouses and other forms of hydroponics widely used today, Famgro is different&#x2014;they build and operate an enterprise level farming system in a warehouse setting and then sell their own branded produce. Today they grow and sell&#xA0;sweet-kale, pac-choi and a variety of micro-greens, with plans to expand their offerings to a variety of lettuces and greens.&#xA0;Steve and his team are a new style of farmer selling fresh, organic produce, and to accomplish this they just so happen to have designed and built the most efficient farms in the world.<strong>The possibility of new partnerships in food production and supply</strong><br> Famgro offers a range of transformational opportunities for both retail partners and food manufacturers. Amazon can&#x2019;t easily plant a 1,000 acre farm in every market it plans to launch Amazon Fresh, and they&#x2019;re not in the business of growing produce locally near all of their distribution centers. Today they have to truck fresh produce across the country. With Famgro farms as a partner in each of their key markets they can&#xA0;grow and sell local fresh-picked produce wherever they are, reducing transportation costs and increasing margins. By moving food production close to the distribution centers, Famgro enables the local production of fresh greens in all corners of the world, removing logistics, weather, water and labor as a variable in the cost of production, with the potential to offer the option of local, fresh, better-than-organic food to all corners of the globe.<strong>A new style of farmer&#x2019;s philosophy</strong><br> Steve keeps <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Emperors-Handbook-Translation-Meditations/dp/0743233832\"><em>The Emperor&#x2019;s Handbook Marcus Aurelius: </em><em>A New Translation of the Meditations</em></a> by his nightstand. He appreciates the classical stoic&#xA0;philosophy because it appeals to logic and reason. One of his favorite quotes says essentially: This is your lot&#x2014;sort it out, get&#xA0;on with it and be pleasant about it.<strong>Every problem is an opportunity when we drown it in passion</strong><br> As I listened to Steve tell his story, I realized he belongs to the tribe of inspiring people who roam the world with their eyes and minds wide open. When they find a problem and realize it&#x2019;s an opportunity for change and progress, they apply all of their efforts to it. Steve looked at the status quo, and rather than being frustrated or overwhelmed by it, he pulled it apart one piece at a time to understand the entire system. He then proceeded to redesign the system into a more productive and efficient process. Some would say Steve applied systems-thinking to solve the problem, but I like to think he applied &#x201C;uncommon sense&#x201D; with a single-minded dose of passion and persistence to design a new kind of farm.<a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Farming_3.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5089\" title=\"Farming_3!\" src=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Farming_3.jpg\" alt width=\"415\" height=\"403\"></a><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"One of the benefits of working at a large company is the support network that comes with it. When someone has a problem with their computer, they simply call the IT department. When travel arrangements are needed, they call the travel hotline. When one has a business question, they can usually find someone within the organization who knows the answer. A big challenge faced by us entrepreneurs when starting our own businesses is the lack of resources and people to help with the enormous amount of tasks we have to accomplish. We are building an Ikea table one day, spending hours dealing with computer issues another day, and negotiating with potential investors the next day&#x2014;all while trying to build our product, attract customers, and manage feedback. The whole startup process can be incredibly overwhelming to manage.There are various ways to get started in building your support network by using the business community as a resource. First, I recommend all entrepreneurs become familiar with their local entrepreneurial ecosystem. Are there popular networking events that can help build your network? Are there seminars where one can meet seasoned entrepreneurs and experts who might turn into helpful mentors or advisors? Second, I recommend entrepreneurs use technology given how easy and efficient it is to get help online these days.This is why I started <a href=\"http://www.mosaichub.com/\" target=\"_blank\">mosaicHUB</a>&#x2014;an online community and resource center for entrepreneurs, allowing them to quickly connect with the right people to help them accomplish their business goals. We believe in the importance of leveraging the power of the business community. By providing a platform for them to come together, share their knowledge, and locate the right experts and business tools, we will make it easier for entrepreneurs to start and grow successful businesses.<strong>Leverage Your Resources</strong><br>A critical skill that every entrepreneur needs to master is being resourceful. We need to accomplish a lot with limited resources and tight budgets. A valuable tool we have at our disposal is the business community, which is incredibly open to helping one another. There are an abundant amount of experts, seasoned entrepreneurs, and various business tools available to assist entrepreneurs in creating successful companies. The key to leveraging the business community as a helpful resource for your is business to know where to look.<strong>Spend Your Time Wisely</strong><br>I have seen so many entrepreneurs reinvent the wheel and spend enormous amounts of valuable time researching products and people. Through mosaicHUB, I was able to help other entrepreneurs quickly and easily connect with the products and people they need, allowing them to spend more of their time building innovative products and services for their communities.<strong>Share What You Know</strong><br>It doesn&#x2019;t take much time to share some advice with others, which is not only a way to demonstrate expertise but a way for you to connect with others. And by contributing online, it&#x2019;s shared with people from around the world, many of whom might not have a strong local business ecosystem. Becoming one of the powerful resources available to other entrepreneurs.<strong>Be Open to Meeting Different People</strong><br>When building a business you need to surround yourself with people different from yourself. Knowing people with different skills will provide you with a pool of expertise to dip into along your entrepreneurial path.<strong>Don&#x2019;t be Afraid to Ask for Help</strong><br>We sometimes hesitate to ask for help because we don&#x2019;t want to be a burden or think we should already know the answer, wasting precious time. Don&#x2019;t be afraid to just ask for help&#x2026; what do you have to lose?<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"I remember every year that I stood in the doorway at my grandma&#x2019;s house so she could place a ruler on top of my head and draw a line on the wall with my name and the date next to it. I loved seeing it go up every year. I loved the day my line went above my older brother&#x2019;s line, and the day I surpassed my father&#x2019;s. Growing was easy. It was like an accomplishment that I did absolutely nothing to achieve, yet still completely owned it and felt great about it.But, growth is a funny thing. When we were young, it was fun and it just happened on its own. And, we loved it. We were just &#x201C;being&#x201D; human. Now that we&#x2019;re older, and we aren&#x2019;t getting taller, growth takes on a new meaning. It takes understanding our shortcomings. It takes focus, rational thought and clarity around what matters most: our goals, priorities and all the complexities that make us human. Instead of just &#x201C;being,&#x201D; we become human &#x201C;doings.&#x201D; Now, growth takes work, which fits perfectly into the next stage our story&#x2014;our professional life.Living in a Capitalistic economy, our worth is now measured by our productivity. How much can we get done in a day? How effective are we? How is our career going? Thus, growth becomes a measurement and a function of our ability to get the job done&#x2014;and, sadly, our professional lives become our identity.When it comes to a company or corporate environment, this dynamic is amplified on a systemic level. It&#x2019;s even more difficult and more complex. It&#x2019;s not to say that companies are the evil empire&#x2014;not at all&#x2014;but it is to say that companies cannot ignore their humanness. And since companies, at their core, are just collections of individuals who now carry the same flag with the same logo on it, it means that people cannot ignore their humanness.The CEO is a person. The VP of Corporate Culture is a person. The person sitting in the adjoining cubicle is a person. The problem is that we have all become human doings. And, since we have now all equated professional growth to personal growth, we put systems in place that measure the wrong thing&#x2014;business goals. We fall back into grandma&#x2019;s doorway and look first to those things that are easiest to measure and align with our false identity: revenues, profits, ROI, market share and anything else we can put on a spreadsheet.Of course, these measurements are important, but they can&#x2019;t be all we measure or track because they don&#x2019;t give us accurate readings of the full picture and don&#x2019;t measure what matters most.This is where it gets tricky because we have to look in the mirror and wrestle with getting back to being human. Down to a cellular level, we are all looking for the same thing. We want purpose, significance, and to be valued. We want to love and be loved, contribute, and deeply hope to make the world a better place. We want to find a new way to grow. A new way to find meaning. To be better than we were the day before&#x2014;better friends, better fathers, better mothers, and better members of our communities.However, this type of growth takes work. It takes asking ourselves the tough questions. It takes making changes that are not easy to make and realizing how little time we spend on the things that we say are most important to us: friends, family, health and relationships. We know that our Life-Value, or Life-ROI, is more important than the ROI of the company for which we work. We know that our life review is more important than our annual job review. It&#x2019;s time to start growing in the areas of our humanness, and then measuring the right things.But, isn&#x2019;t this how it&#x2019;s supposed to be? Isn&#x2019;t this what we all want on a bigger level? What if our world was full of people who truly understood why they matter&#x2014;to themselves, their friends, their family, their community and, yes, their company? What if we cherished the fact that the flag with the logo on it is not what connects us and not our identity? What if we embraced and promoted personal growth, value and understanding, and truly made it a part of every aspect of life?For starters, the world would be a better place. Not a bad start. But, isn&#x2019;t it fair to consider that a company of enthusiastic, motivated, realized, purpose-filled individuals would always outperform the opposite on any business measure we choose? The line on grandma&#x2019;s doorway would get higher and higher every single year and grandma would need taller doors.So, let&#x2019;s start measuring what matters most. Let&#x2019;s make sure we deploy programs and invest in resources that help create a work culture that allows people to be human and wrestle with what it means to grow. This does not threaten or weaken our companies, rather it strengthens them and allows us to work together better and produce greater results. The good news is that we call the shots. Remember, we are the company and the company is we. It&#x2019;s up to us. Let&#x2019;s grow again&#x2026; we matter.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Two major topics have been cropping up in my recent discussions about communications. The first is about purposeful brands&#x2014;how brands must have a point of view, a motivation, a reason to exist. The second hot topic is about the rise of a new age of communications: instead of top-down, one way, from one to many, we have finally come to the era of dialogue and co-creation. The two issues are closely linked. After all, for a customer to be willing to participate in this dialogue and to relate more deeply to a brand, they must be able to identify the brand&#x2019;s ideas, values and causes with ones of their own.<br><br>Today, major brands and agencies around the world are working on choosing their purpose and preparing to (at least) be able to respond in a conversation with the consumer. But what I&apos;m seeing is still extremely shallow. And when I speak of superficiality, I&apos;m not judging the depth of the purpose, but rather the truth with which it is delivered. The purpose does not need to be worthy of a Nobel Peace prize, but it needs to be true, credible and above all, genuinely lived by the brand in question. Chipotle is &apos;cultivating a better world&apos; and Red Bull helps you to achieve whatever you want to. All right. We are not passing judgement. No one purpose is more important than another. But what&#x2019;s important is which are real and which are only decorative. There is a long road between saying that you&apos;re going to do something and actually doing it.<br><br>I believe that only brands with profound clarity about their purpose can be open for a genuine dialogue with their consumers. They can be up-front in discussions and find new ways to refine their views without the fear of being caught in a lie.<br><br>In Brazil, we have seen a brand recently epitomize the gap between words and action. Skol, a leading beer brand in the country, launched a pre-carnival campaign quite in line with the brand positioning: celebrating impulsiveness and fun. However, one of the pieces communicated, &#x2018;I left &quot;no&quot; at home&#x2019; which generated much controversy. Two friends found that the piece encouraged the abuse of women and made a new version of it, adding to the title &#x2018;I left &quot;no&quot; at home and BROUGHT NEVER&#x2019;. The new version spread quickly and by the end of the day the brand released a statement saying they would discontinue the campaign. A few days later, a new campaign aired with the message: &#x2018;In this carnival, show respect.&#x2019;<br><br>However, it&#x2019;s possible to find some positives from the Skol case: the brand listened to complaints and responded fast, quickly enough to take the controversial pieces off the streets and replace them with a new message. But, as I see it, both Skol and the feminist movement have missed a great opportunity.<br><br>There was no dialogue. Certainly the agency that created the campaign worked hard, did their research and would have considered alternative creative ideas and, with the client, chose this option as a winning campaign. The negative impact turned the success criteria into minimizing the negative backlash. Fear bested motivation.<br><br>All the free media coverage generated through the controversy was a golden opportunity for the brand to really discuss its purpose and talk to people. But no. Crisis management mode was activated, aka &#x2018;let&#x2019;s get people to stop talking about it&#x2019;. And the opportunity passed. Minimized risks, annihilated gains.<br><br>Beer brands have always been the target of feminist criticism. How could the Skol brand and social movements have benefited from this dialogue? Where would we have gotten if we had actually discussed all the impulsive actions and disrespect that happen duringcarnival? How and with what credibility would have this brand&#x2019;s purpose been reawakened?<br><br>It&#x2019;s essential to find a purpose that you trust, which you do not doubt in the first 100 shares of a complaint. A purpose that drives not only what you do, but more importantly, how your brand does things. From this starting point you can create a genuine two-way, bottom-up, crowdsourced communication.<br><br>Say it, Do it, Be it need to coexist, it is vital that they are simultaneous and in sync to be true. &#xA0;<br><br><br><em>Article originally posted on <a href=\"http://www.contagious.com/blogs/news-and-views/17311840-opinion-say-it-do-it-be-it\" target=\"_blank\">Contagious</a>.</em><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "date":"December 21, 2014",
       "principle":"ARE YOU FOR REAL?",
       "content_body":"We are talking about a level of customer loyalty that all business brands aspire to, as their passion for your products and services and their engagement turns them into brand ambassadors with promotional power that can reap huge benefits for your business.It is in fact a very subtle form of collaboration, the building of a bond between company and customer that in many ways can be more powerful than a formal collaborative agreement between two brands. That&#x2019;s because customer collaboration is based on mutual admiration, respect and goodwill, and not a legal agreement in sight.You only have to look at Virgin to see this brand connection in action. In the West Coast rail debacle of 2012, when Virgin Trains almost lost the franchise to FirstGroup, regular Virgin passengers were incensed, not just at the idea of change, or fears of price increases, or even the flawed tendering process, but at the prospect of losing a quality, iconic brand that they knew and loved.So how do you get your customers to not only choose your brand, your goods and your services, over all others, but also spread the word to others about great they are? And how do you collaborate with your customers in this way and turn them into your brand ambassadors when you are a small business? ForBasingstoke-based homemade chocolate business <a href=\"http://www.owowchocolates.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Owow Chocolates</a>, the answer seems simple; produce exceptional chocolates. But while quality product is important, on its own it is not enough, says founder and director Mike Peates.He says: &#x201C;You have to show the human side of the business as well, and I believe that this is what encourages people to talk about you in positive tones. My view was that we would grow our early adopters and &#x2018;sneezers&#x2019;, people who would spread the word, to quote Seth Godin, and through that process our brand presence would swell.&#x201D;Peates was relentless with his use of social media in the early stages, not by selling, but by engaging with and talking to people, creating a real buzz around his brand. He also sent small six-pack boxes of chocolates to selected businesses that he engaged with on Twitter.&#x201C;Essentially, they were those I was confident would take a picture and tweet upon receipt, companies like <a href=\"http://jimmysicedcoffee.com\" target=\"_blank\">Jimmy&apos;s Iced Coffee</a>, <a href=\"http://eyeteasemedia.com\" target=\"_blank\">Eyetease</a>, and M<a href=\"http://www.minicabit.com\" target=\"_blank\">ini Cabit</a>. They basically do your PR for you. They have large followings and a picture from them shared with all their followers is marketing power that you simply can&#x2019;t buy.&#x201D; Owow Chocolates&#x2019; brand ambassadors haven&#x2019;t disappointed. Launched last July, the company has turned over &#xA3;18,000, well ahead of its first year target of &#xA3;12,000. Peates is now in negotiations with a promotional gift company to supply a low cost airline, the likely turnover for which will be in the region of &#xA3;20,000 per month; a business game changer, as he puts it.Sending product samples as gifts is one way of grabbing people&#x2019;s interest, and impressing them enough to compel them to tell others about you, but how do entrepreneurs who provide a service rather than a product recruit their brand ambassadors?When Dave and Anna France launched their home-based dog boarding business <a href=\"http://www.bestpawforward.net\" target=\"_blank\">Best Paw Forward</a> in Bolton in 2012 no other business in their area was offering such a personalized, &#x2018;home from home&#x2019; pet care service. &#x201C;Local dog owners quickly realized how much nicer it was for their beloved family pet to spend a week in our home than in kennels,&#x201D; said Dave. &#x201C;Once we had our first few customers, word travelled fast, and within a few months our business was growing fast.&#x201D;What their customers really appreciated was being able to see what their pooch was up to while they were at work or on holiday, thanks to the Frances posting regular picture and video updates of them on the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bestpawforwardwi?sk=wall\" target=\"_blank\">Best Paw Forward Facebook page</a>.&#x201C;That gives them peace of mind, and when it comes to people and their dogs, that really is crucial. It&#x2019;s mainly thanks to our customers telling other people about us that we now have dogs in our home seven days a week,&#x201D; said Anna France.Where there are top quality products and services and delighted customers there are opportunities for building these collaborative connections that can produce enthusiastic ambassadors for the brand. And don&#x2019;t forget your disgruntled customers, which every business will have at some stage. Research has shown that by dealing with a complaint respectfully and efficiently, people are inclined to be grateful and to tell others, and may also go on to become brand ambassadors for your business.<em>Article originally posted on the <a href=\"http://www.virgin.com/entrepreneur/how-to-collaborate-with-your-customers-and-turn-them-into-brand-ambassadors\" target=\"_blank\">Virgin Entrepreneur Blog</a>.</em><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Welcome to the Information Age. A current phase taking place in our society where communication and data flow fast and furious, and people are able to obtain knowledge with a simple keystroke. Items formerly swept under the proverbial rug are no longer hidden. People are free to share their POV and wave their banners proudly. Transparency allows knowledge to be gained and communications to commence. These are all good things. Sometimes.<strong>Design your actions with intentionality<br></strong>I acknowledge and applaud those who have chosen to stand up for change. I support, and many times agree with, what is being espoused&#x2014;but sometimes I see the freedom of digital speech go wrong. Too many times blogs begin with a discussion about an important or interesting topic but the post quickly goes south when all eyes are made to focus on the person writing the article and not the topic at hand. These individuals want to be labeled the new, cool term &#x201C;<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinehoward/2013/03/27/you-say-innovator-i-say-disruptor-whats-the-difference/\">disruptor</a>&#x201D; and be regarded as those who go against the grain. There&#x2019;s even a group that calls itself <a href=\"http://disrupthr.co/disruptors\">Disrupt</a>, comprised of individuals (many are bloggers) who waive their disruptor banner proudly.<strong>Does passion fuel intentionality?<br></strong>I&#x2019;ve always believed that people who stand up for change and defend causes are doing it because they are driven to do so, because of the cause&#x2014;not to build a case for a desired label. No problem, rock on, but don&#x2019;t mistake protests about an unjust practice or policy as giving back when in reality it&#x2019;s self-serving. If someone truly wants to see change, be the change. If the cause is good and impactful others will see and listen. It&#x2019;s wrong to manipulate people into believing important information is being shared, when in reality the driving force behind the words is only to garner the reputation of a cool kid.<strong>Don&#x2019;t disrupt the disruptor<br></strong>A few months ago, I was reading a well-known blogger&#x2019;s post that had attracted many comments. One of the respondents challenged the author and included links to research that supported his POV. The author&#x2019;s vitriolic response was biting and ended with the comment, &#x201C;<em>I&#x2019;m not defending my POV. This is my blog and if you don&#x2019;t like it, you can f*^* off</em>.&#x201D; Well, I guess he told him. Out of curiosity, I revisited the site the next day to see if additional comments were posted. Yep, there they were. Supplementary comments were not on the article&#x2019;s topic, but on the response made by the author&#x2014;the latecomers raised their hands in support of the author&#x2019;s anger and nary said a word about the content of the article. I don&#x2019;t believe the responder supported his challenge very well because his research was weak, but his right to free speech was cut short by someone who considers himself a disruptor and not to be challenged. If the author deemed his content to be sound and read-worthy, he should have provided commentary that supported his point of view. Frankly, everyone involved in that chain of replies failed miserably. I still visit that blog from time to time and have not seen an exchange as unsavory. But this blogger has earned the label of self-serving malcontent, not disruptor for the good of change.<strong>Consideration fuels the intentional disruptor<br></strong>So to everyone reading this blog post, I hope consideration is given to your future writings. Do you hope to affect change? Do you have important information to share? Are you writing as a benefit for others? No doubt this post will make some people uncomfortable and some angry, while others will share my viewpoint and confirm it publically or privately.My intention is neither to gather the forces behind me nor to assemble them in front of me. I&#x2019;m simply asking for deeper circumspection about intentions. In some of my previous blog posts I&#x2019;ve called out practices, processes and groups of people as outdated or misinformed. I stand behind those words. I wrote them with the intention to share a point of view, not with malicious intent, and certainly not to acquire the label of disruptor. Disruption should occur at the cause level, not with individuals longing to garner the label. A focus on the cause should be, and never waiver from, the cause itself. This is true intention. This is where a cause gains strength in numbers. &#xA0;&#xA0;<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

From personal and professional recalibration to the re-mastering of entire industries, categories and educational platforms, people, no matter how young or old, are sharing creative avenues of reinvention. The time is nigh and the&#xA0;marketplace is heating up with people&#x2019;s new ideas of engagement motivated by how they wish to live.With such change at hand we see larger ships and brands having trouble turning on a dime; smaller, agile startups, entrepreneurs or solopreneurs are better able to create in &#x201C;beta.&#x201D; The startup mentality is touted as a major influencer in business today as it addresses a landscape in flux with evolutionary iterations of active versus reactive engagements. What does this look like in practice?<em>&#x201C;The world is a better place and companies thrive when the worker is inspired, connected and able to understand and contribute at a higher level.&#x201D; &#x2013;<a href=\"http://blog.cre8tivegirl.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Yvonne Perez Emerson</a>, Founder of </em><em><a href=\"http://wemakepdx.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WeMake</a>&#xA0;</em><em>Portland, Oregon</em><strong>Innovation through lifelong learning&#xA0;<br></strong>I spoke recently with Yvonne Emerson Perez, a design studio owner in Portland, Oregon who eats, sleeps and breathes agile reinvention. She has turned her studio into an inspiration engine for the community she serves.WeMake is a creativity-based community, curating inspirational experiences based on do-it-yourself inventiveness, old world craft and new world thinking. Through programs, gatherings and experiences, attendees leverage their own assets, knowledge, skillsets and motivations in a side-by-side environment known as the WeMake community. Yvonne has established herself as the content facilitator, while the community drives the direction it takes through group contribution, engagement and response.<strong>Passion fuels contribution and growth</strong><br>Brands can learn from Yvonne&#x2019;s business principles by fostering an open environment for innovation, inspiration, group collaboration and contribution, challenging the way things have seemingly always been done. Yvonne describes branding and design as a community responsibility: &#x201C;In order for me to be a good brand creator/leader and designer I am responsible to explore and push myself beyond my comfort zones, beyond my periphery and into the world at large. Whether it is learning real life skills such as making chocolate, leather-crafting, sketching or building a bird house; whether it&#x2019;s sharing creative processes together with other thought leaders and doers or engaging in give-back benefits for art education, engaging in evolving ourselves ups the game for everyone.&#x201D;As time goes by, people within the platform not only educate each other but are becoming more willing to contribute to group and personal reinvention overall. This challenges their embedded feelings to compete and be the best at all costs, resulting in a collection of creative individuals building upon and competing through healthier roads of contribution.Today people are overworked, overwhelmed and over-consumed and seek simpler, more potent ways to live, connect and contribute. Communities like WeMake are paving the path for companies to assume responsibility in creating amazing experiences, teaching creatively what they know to the world and accelerating everyone involved. These self-styled innovation and skill-set platforms are the new ways and means that enable us to rebuild, reeducate, reinvent, and design lives, professions, and careers, and ultimately our society as a whole.In a world in which education is expensive, not yet retooled or up to date, living life in beta can mean relying on each other to educate and inspire&#x2014;groups such as WeMake play a vital role.In challenging times it can be important to remember the adage: If my town does well (town meaning company, industry, community, family, state, nation, etc.), we all do well. With this attitude in mind, imagine the possibilities.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"In wrestling, it&#x2019;s known as a &#x201C;heel turn.&#x201D; A good guy, a so-called &#x201C;babyface,&#x201D; does something heinous&#x2014;double-crosses a partner, defames the U.S., declares he wants to be known as Fabulous Francesca from now on&#x2014;all intended to rile up the audience. He becomes a &#x201C;heel,&#x201D; a bad guy, a mustachio-twirling villain&#x2014;and he&#x2019;s the most important thing in the world for whatever promotion he is wrestling for. Now, the branding of wrestling may look garish, silly and over-the-top. Those who consider themselves to be serious and oh-so-adult&#x2014;professionals of text and image&#x2014;often think they&#x2019;re above the man-child antics of wrestling. However, despite our condescension, good ol&#x2019; wrasslin&#x2019; has a lot to teach us, and nowhere is this more visible than among the heels.In wrestling, the heel turn is a necessary move to create &#x201C;heat,&#x201D; i.e. audience response. A hero on his own is boring and no matter how beloved a character is, without a foil he becomes the storyline equivalent of a Hallmark card. The heel and the heel turn is what makes matches matter, and it is the introduction of a heel that crafts the story an audience can invest in emotionally. Without him or her, wrestling is just a strange, sweaty, stumbling dance&#x2014;shiny muscles in leotards for no apparent reason. With a heel, on the other hand, it can become a powerful story of trials and redemption. The lessons for branding should be obvious to all.Today, branding often lacks heels, and as a result, branding has become boring and dull. In fact, it has become the antithesis of branding. Stating you&#x2019;re for the same things everyone else is&#x2014;authenticity, ecology, &#x201C;being close to the customer&#x2019;&#x201D;&#x2014;is not branding, but pandering. Trying to tell your customers what you think they&#x2019;d like to hear is not branding, but kissing ass. Clumsily. Claiming to stand for something whilst being unable to say who might stand for the opposite is not branding, but a particularly vacuous form of bullshit.Yes, branding should be about generating heat. About making yourself matter in a market filled with lookalikes and bland brands. About doing something more than latching onto popular, already legitimized attributes. Branding should be about standing out and standing apart, even if you risk someone getting offended over it. This&#x2014;standing apart&#x2014;is risky and will come at a cost, but this is what makes it meaningful. In order to become someone&#x2019;s champion, you need to dare to also become someone else&#x2019;s heel.When Cadillac created the by now infamous &#x201C;Poolside&#x201D; ad, in which a smug man talks smugly about things smug men love, this wasn&#x2019;t just a retro ad for a brand-weary age. Instead it was a smarter-than-you&#x2019;d-think way to get people to feel something for the brand again, a heel turn designed to make Cadillac catch a little heat, and a delicious one at that. No, it almost certainly didn&#x2019;t convert those who were already convinced that Cadillac was a brand for smug men, but it got them riled up. In a fell, if not heroic, swoop, Cadillac started to matter again. For no matter what Upworthy is trying to tell you, no matter how much of the shiny-happy Kool-Aid you drink, mattering is not just about telling lovely stories, the kind that create warm, fuzzy feelings, it&#x2019;s also about figuring out who you&#x2019;re not like, and what you stand against.Last week, I chatted with an old friend of mine, a professional creator of brands and brand stories. He fretted about the fact that more and more work in the field was becoming esoteric, filled with evermore complex and difficult-to-read brand books and stories convoluted enough to require their own professionals of exegetics. We talked about how many at the front lines of the brand&#x2019;s engagement with customers always end up losing touch with all this, mouthing slogans without any real idea why they&#x2019;re doing it. In such a situation, branding becomes an almost parodic exercise, ripe for ironic re-appropriation.I suggested that this is partly due to the situation implied above. In most companies, people are well aware of the often tepid list of brand attributes a colloquium of suits from marketing, operations, sales and HR have grudgingly agreed on&#x2014;the list of meaningless words that were committed to not because they mattered, but because they didn&#x2019;t offended anyone. The same people have also been subjected to the cheery PowerPoints where this bland gruel is adorned with technicolor giddiness and hashtags (oh so many hashtags&#x2026;), without ever learning why this would in any meaningful way be different from the technicolor giddiness of the competition. It&#x2019;s not surprising many of them have stopped believing in the whole thing.What they haven&#x2019;t been given is the reason why all this matters. They know they&#x2019;re supposedly the babyface, but they have no idea who the heel is. They&#x2019;re part of a performance without having been told who represents the foe. They know everything about the product or service they&#x2019;re selling, but they do not know why selling it matters.Thus, branding work needs to take a page from the pages of wrestling, and consider who the heel is. No, I&#x2019;m not advocating that each brand needs to become a heel for someone (although planning this is a productive exercise as well). What I am advocating is thinking through who might <em>not&#xA0;</em>enjoy your brand, and who your brand should stand up <em>against</em><strong>.</strong>&#xA0;I am advocating mattering to some, even if it means becoming less attractive to someone else.Here&#x2019;s the fun part: Even in wrestling, there are always people cheering for both sides. A heel can become a hero, and a hero, a heel. Tables are turned (and people are thrown through them) for wrestlers have long realized that what matters is the storyline and making this matter. When everyone tries to be popular, no one truly is. And when no one dares to take the unpopular stand, everyone suffers. What wrestlers know, and brand professionals often miss, is that if no one hates you, you probably don&#x2019;t matter.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

So often we complain and point out the problems government and our society face today, yet most of us do nothing to contribute to the solution. The problem is typically considered too big for a single person to drive change or create a meaningful impact, but not for Ana and Alex Bogusky. They both set out to encourage people that their actions do have an impact. They rolled up their sleeves and started the Million Jobs Initiative, a video project that gives us all something to DO about the economy and the decline of American jobs.<br><br>This simple video illustrates how our purchase decisions and actions impact society in a variety of ways.&#xA0; It shows how each purchase we make has a very real impact, on American jobs, the economy, and society on a global scale. The video encourages Americans to support US manufacturers when the option is available, and makes a compelling case for our purchase decisions having a big impact on both the present and the future.<br><br>Manufacturing 3.0 needs to be leaner and greener to support a new global lifestyle. Manufacturing innovation coming from 3D printing, biomimicry and other transformational drivers will be developed with manufacturing partners. In tomorrow&#x2019;s world we will either be exporting or buying this next phase in technological know-how. The US has developed much of the manufacturing technology used worldwide today, and I think we&#x2019;d all like to see us lead the charge again. That&#x2019;s the reason it&#x2019;s imperative that we support American made products.<br><br>The Boguskys hope the video will raise the conversation around American jobs, and the role we play as consumers making deliberate choices. They hope it will help Americans to consciously change our buying and consumption habits so that by our actions, we can encourage others to do the same.<br><br>If you buy US made products, you&#x2019;re doing so with a greater likelihood that the products are made with stringent EPA policies, that the products are greener, that US labor laws ensure children aren&#x2019;t employed in the making of the products, that overall working conditions are safer, and that less CO2 is used transporting the products to your door.<br><br>And finally, at a time when middle class jobs are being replaced with low wage McJobs, it&#x2019;s time to support the jobs that can support individuals.<br><br>Watch the video, and share it with your friends and family, and do your part to advance the conversation and the need for more American Jobs. And the next time you make a purchase, ask yourself what impact does this have?<br><br>Watch the video here.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"It&#x2019;s just so hard to get away.There are meetings, decisions to be made, people who need me.If that sounds like you, well, you aren&#x2019;t alone. Last year, <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/05/23/vacation-time-americans-unused/\">more than half of American workers ended the year with unused vacation days in the bank</a>.It&#x2019;s easy to cast blame around, there are so many responsibilities, so many people to whom we are accountable. There&#x2019;s just not enough time, not enough hours in a day, a week, a year.Yes, the hours are fixed. The 26-hour day hasn&#x2019;t been created. Time is immutable.Right now, it&#x2019;s time for you to change. It&#x2019;s time to drop the preciousness around the notion that you are irreplaceable. You&#x2019;re not. None of us are. And yet, we spend an inordinate amount of time at work acting as if we were; and it&#x2019;s not serving anyone well.Moving through the workplace as if it cannot function without you weakens your team. It creates an air of dependence that could hobble them if you were to leave. It limits their ability to grow and to make decisions without constantly relying on your approval. It also limits their investment in the company by denying them meaningful ownership in the decision-making process.Equally bad is the fact that seeing yourself as irreplaceable limits to you. When you see your place in the company as fundamentally essential, it can hinder your willingness to grow in your career. If you see yourself as irreplaceable, you risk putting down roots so deep you will never leave. The time will never be right.What&#x2019;s to be done?<strong>Delegate decisions where appropriate.</strong> Begin to let members of your team make decisions without running them by you first. It will empower them and you as you begin to recognize that their strengths benefit you as well.<strong>Take a two-week vacation.</strong> Two weeks sounds heretical, doesn&#x2019;t it? Actually, it&#x2019;s a great strategic move. If you only leave for a week, the team will set aside problems and decision-making to await your return. Go for two weeks and they will find they can address more than they realized. What&#x2019;s waiting for you after vacation will be those items that genuinely demand your attention.<strong>Remember that time is immutable and life is finite</strong>. In his famous <a href=\"https://news.stanford.edu/2005/06/14/jobs-061505/\">Stanford commencement speech</a>, Steve Jobs said, &#x201C;Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life&#x2019;s change agent.&#x201D; Manage your time and your team in ways that embrace replace-ability. It will happen eventually, that much we know.But seriously, use up those vacation days.&#xA0;<em>Read more from these <a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/author/todd-putman-and-lori-sparger#filters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">authors</a>.&#xA0;</em><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

Highlight reel moments of births, graduations, weddings, great accomplishments and that perfect slice of NY pizza. (FYI: there is no debate.)And simple moments of making pancakes with your kid, walking your dog, finding the right gif to respond to a friend and hitting all the green lights on the way to work. But, what if I told you joy is more of a state of being you can cultivate, not a moment to be orchestrated or left to chance. Forget about me, what if the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Desmond Tutu told you?&#xA0; Well, they have. And, it&#x2019;s simply called <em>The Book of Joy</em>, a book I highly recommend you spend some time with.<strong>The Secret</strong>While you may think you are getting the inside scoop on joy forged by the friendship of two of the world&#x2019;s most well-known spiritual leaders, I&#x2019;ll be the one who bursts your joy bubble. There is no secret. Rather, the book makes this most wonderful of states, joy, accessible no matter your circumstances. If there is any secret, it simply is that cultivating joy in your own life is most often a result of using your talents in service of others. <em>In giving we receive</em> is alive and well in the 21<sup>st</sup> century and these two giants of men share the why, how and what to make it all happen.<strong>An Operating Manual for Life</strong><a href=\"http://bookofjoy.org/\"><em>The Book of Joy</em></a> is a story of friendship, humanity and wisdom which coalesces in the eight <em>Pillars of Joy</em> &#x2013; Perspective, Humility, Humor, Acceptance, Forgiveness, Gratitude, Compassion and Generosity &#x2013; a virtual operating manual for cultivating a joyful spirit.Many of the Pillars are what you expect, but each carries with it at least one unique perspective upon which to reflect.<strong>Joy Is Life</strong>Perhaps we were meant to live in joy. If it truly is not dependent on our current circumstances, that it is a choice. The choice is certainly harder for some than others, but the more focus and training to act and react in joy, the easier the choice gets.&#xA0;<em>Written while listening to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Earthtones-Bahamas/dp/B0771RS6V6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bahamas&#x2019; Earthtones</a>.</em><em>Read more from <a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/author/mark-tomaszewicz#filters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mark</a>.&#xA0;</em><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"The mountain of articles, posts and books written on leadership every year reflects two realities. First, people are very interested in how to be an effective leader. And second, leadership isn&#x2019;t a one-size-fits-all endeavor. The lessons mined from one leader&#x2019;s experience may not be applicable in a different context. More than offering leadership development, organizations can address this reality by creating a culture of leadership.Creating a culture of leadership has four primary components: Self-mastery, Action, Relationship and Context.<strong>Self-mastery </strong>is the power to control one&apos;s actions, impulses or emotions. Leaders who are focused and motivated tend to achieve their goals, steer their teams, and ultimately their companies, to success. An orchestra conductor is a good example of how the ability to communicate in both verbal and non-verbal ways can transform a performance. Conductor and musicians are able to connect to one another to achieve cohesion. The gestures of the conductor get the best playing out of the musicians. This is very much the essence of leadership. The goal attained is directly related to one&#x2019;s ability to practice self control and be able to share values with one&#x2019;s teammates in order to affect sustainable change and success.<strong>Action </strong>is essential in leadership. Leaders must walk the talk. No matter the place, within a family or in business. one&#x2019;s word must reflect in actions or be demonstrated through priorities. Our activities are to be designed to influence and motivate those we lead, otherwise our talk becomes ineffective and will bear no fruit. Great leaders cast a compelling vision for the change they expect to see in the world. They lay out a purpose for the organization and then set the context for the business with a clear and compelling strategy. They help to nurture the individual and institutional belief that anything is possible, and they effectively harness the collective capability and skills of the group to achieve results. Teammates care about leaders&#x2019; conduct, their decisions, how they treat those around them, the language they use, especially in bad times, and their credibility during a business transaction and more. Actions show who we are and inspire others to follow.<strong>Relationship </strong>is the essential heartbeat of leadership. The level of effort leaders make to connect with people determines the extent of the lasting impact of the organization over time. People are not perfect and the building of relationships can have its challenges. Lead with purpose and others will follow the patterns you have sewn. In our digital environments relationships can be built effectively. And recognizing talents, no matter where they may be geographically within an organization, is now much more possible than it was a few years ago. Take as an example a global company like GE that developed a digital platform called GE Colab designed to facilitate global teamwork and collaboration.In an interview by <a href=\"http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/ges-colab-brings-good-things-to-the-company/\">MITSloan</a> with Ron Utterbeck, CIO of GE, he explains how GE Colab combines the capabilities of Facebook, Twitter and other social applications, allowing networking, communication, search and video blogs as part of its many functions. Such a platform and concept for collaboration can offer a good opportunity for leadership development or to recognize the leaders within one&#x2019;s organization.<strong>Context. </strong>In the corporate setting it is important to match leadership skills to the right circumstances. A great deal of academic research has shown that leadership is determined by its context. Given the pace of change today, the ability to nurture a leadership culture that is able to adapt to external competitive challenges or the shifts to business models is critically important. As the needs of a business change over time, so do the qualities required for leadership. Some years ago while working in Asia for a global bank we realized that it was best to train local leaders to address our new regional business model. Our strategy proved to be a good one for our customers and product development for that marketplace. One size doesn&apos;t fit all in leadership, there is no silver bullet. Recognizing change and adjusting accordingly requires a high degree of insight and a <a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/the-power-of-why-how-childlike-humility-and-curiosity-can-inform-inspire-and-unlock-new-ideas\">continuous learning-mindset</a>.Creating a culture of leaders is a continuous process that requires leaders to move away from the day-to-day routine and become internal change agents not simply role models. To achieve this, a company must develop the necessary roadmap that outlines how it will meet that objective &#x2014;placing a focus on <a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/cultivating-culture-in-every-moment\">leadership behavior</a>&#x2014;and like GE, create the supporting systems that can inspire all employees to think and work in a more engaging way.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Blogging is a funny business. It&#x2019;s a new phenomenon, so it&#x2019;s constantly and rapidly evolving. There are no rules or procedures to follow, and most of the time, you&#x2019;re making it up as you go along&#x2014;in the most professional, inspiring and valuable way possible, of course.&#xA0;There&#x2019;s no class offered at the university to learn how to &#x201C;make it work&#x201D; as a full-time blogger (though at this point, I&#x2019;m sure it&#x2019;s only around the corner) and generally success is built upon networking, being brave and simply giving 110%. But then again, that&#x2019;s not exclusive to blogging, is it?Being self-employed and having your own business is a guessing game at its finest. There&#x2019;s no one to tell you when to switch off at 5pm, and working from the bed/sofa/train is a new and necessary pastime. At the best of times, you feel like you could get sussed out at any minute, as it&#x2019;s somewhat impossible to know your value with no one above you to let you know if you&#x2019;re even doing this &#x201C;thing&#x201D; right. It&#x2019;s scary, exciting and each day is completely different from the last.The hardest thing about blogging as a business is having it be accepted as one. Admittedly there are times I&#x2019;m asked, &#x201C;So, what is your real job?&#x201D; or, &#x201C;What else do you do apart from blogging?&#x201D; It can be difficult to respond, and arduous to find yourself justifying your career to someone as having importance in a saturated and ever growing industry (<em>I&#x2019;m trying&#x2014;and I certainly do more than wear pink dresses, eat macaroons and post about it on the internet</em>). Although justification can be somewhat exhausting at times, it can also fuel your inspiration and determination.As long as people keep reading, I&#x2019;ll keep writing. Being self-motivated isn&#x2019;t always an easy task, but ultimately comes down to being inspired and knowing that anything is, and can be, possible. Mindset is a powerful thing, and if you believe in yourself, you can break down the barriers. Once you&#x2019;re confident and you begin to soak up the inspiration that surrounds you, it&#x2019;s up to you to harness its power.When I started writing my blog four years ago, I was so inspired by the beautiful photographs, homegrown and eloquent writing skills and style these girls possessed that I was determined to get a snip of the action myself. I had no idea that in four years time I&#x2019;d be reaching out to a global audience and winning blog awards for doing the same. It&#x2019;s surreal and a bit mind blowing, but it shows that even a girl who used to wait tables and sell popcorn at a shopping mall stand on Saturdays can follow her dreams&#x2014;completely corny, but ultimately true.I&#x2019;m here to tell you that anyone can have a slice of this style, food and lifestyle filled pie&#x2014;it&#x2019;s yours for the taking. Just don&#x2019;t give up when you&#x2019;re still writing to a handful of people (or, <em>ahem</em>, your parents). The dedication is worth it and pays off, I promise&#x2014;just mind your own business.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

Each was designed&amp;nbsp;to share a common understanding and language for innovation, behaviors and techniques to help drive innovative thinking and build new concepts for development.As a key takeaway, Bulldog designed a deck of Pioneering cards to help the Lenovo team develop new innovation techniques. The deck consists of exercises that inspire new ways to observe the world, connect ideas, ask better questions, hunt for diverse ideas, and experiment and test concepts.The cards were designed for individual use or within a group setting.

Strategic sequencing is simply the arranging of items in a specific order for a specific purpose&#x2014;what goes first, second, third, and so on.And more often than not stuff does not self-sequence automatically. That is the job of the leader.<strong>Order as a Competitive Advantage</strong><br>The purpose of good sequencing is to gain an advantage.While bad sequencing leads to inefficiencies, redundancy, and guesswork, good sequencing can help build on prior momentum.

None of this is minor. If she gets the timing or? the order wrong on one or more of these items, it could turn Fat Tuesday into Scrawny Tuesday for her business.<strong>Payoff of Sequencing Done Well</strong>To sequence well, step back and take a wide-angle view of your business or nonprofit.

Despite many attempts by teams from all over the world, the English-led expedition was the first to successfully put a man on top of the mountain.&#xA0;The accomplishment catapulted Hillary to a household name, knighthood, and eventually on the New Zealand $5 bill.&#xA0;The reality is Hillary was an amazing man whose accomplishments beyond Everest were very impressive; reaching both of the poles and summiting many of the highest peaks in the world. But had he not been the first man to stand on the summit of Everest he wouldn&#x2019;t have become the man we all know today.A standard principle of any adventure is that the journey is far more rewarding than the result.&#xA0;Take time to enjoy the journey, but there is a cold reality&#x2014;if you don&#x2019;t stand on top, the world is not as interested in your journey. The journey and your personal growth along the way are critical&#x2026; but only to you.There are a number of clear lessons to take from the Hillary&#x2019;s expedition that are worth acknowledging for any person working to summit their own Mount Everest.<strong>What&#x2019;s in the name<br> </strong>Conquering the tallest mountain on earth is an incredibly easy concept to pass along.&#xA0;For your results to matter they need to be easy for a common audience to digest.&#xA0;Whatever you&#x2019;re working towards needs to be provocative and exciting.&#xA0;And the results should be clearly outlined with your goals.<strong>Results don&#x2019;t come alone<br> </strong>I&#x2019;ve been lucky enough to be mentored by a few noteworthy managers&#x2014;one who taught me &#x201C;you can go fast alone or far together, develop a team and you will go far&#x201D;. Hillary embodied this concept&#x2014;he understood that his partnership with Sherpa Tensing Norgay was critical to his success.&#xA0;Hillary and Norgay worked as equals and had to depend on each other with their lives.&#xA0;On the mountain they were quite literally tied together and saved each other&#x2019;s lives on more than one occasion.&#xA0;If not for this partnership, trust, and camaraderie Hillary would never have made it to the top.&#xA0;<strong>Working relationships are strong but a team of friends is even stronger<br> </strong>Hillary partnered with Tensing Norgay and established a friendship that would last a lifetime.&#xA0;Co-workers can do a lot, but friends can stand on top of the world. Norgay and Hillary didn&#x2019;t just climb together, and it wasn&#x2019;t simply a partnership of convenience, they became genuine friends.&#xA0;When setting off on a journey you should go with trusted friends.&#xA0;But it takes more than one partner. Norgay was not the only friend who Hillary depended on&#x2014;there was a community of friends and associates who supported the expedition both directly and indirectly.&#xA0; For example, George Lowe one of Hillary&#x2019;s closest friends, carried massive loads of equipment and helped set-up camp before Hillary set off for the summit.&#xA0;Some goals take skill while others take persistence. A friend of mine said, &#x201C;Everest isn&#x2019;t all that hard, it&#x2019;s just a lesson in suffering.&#x201D; He has climbed the tallest peak on every continent and is a man I wholeheartedly respect.&#xA0;So when he detailed Everest as technically easy, but emotionally draining I listened. &#xA0;Hillary&#x2019;s expedition took months, and through years of experience led to the summit push.&#xA0;To accomplish your goal there may be some suffering, but any outcome that big is worth making the push.<strong>Results are the great equalizer<br> </strong>When someone succeeds no one cares where they came from. Hillary was from New Zealand, but was hailed as a hero throughout the entire Commonwealth and the world.&#xA0;When people make it to the top&#x2014;either literally or metaphorically&#x2014;suddenly their past is far less meaningful.&#xA0;This is extremely valuable to me because I came from a very different industry and background, however by showing good results and strong contributions my managers and co-workers see me as their equal.<strong>With incredible results comes the requirement to look at what you can do<br> </strong>Hillary became almost as well known for his work giving back to the people of Nepal.&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.himalayantrust.org/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">The Himalayan Trust</a>&#xA0;bearing his name is dedicated to &#x201C;improving the quality of life of the Sherpa people&#x201D;. Hillary&#x2019;s dedication and feeling of obligation to give back to the group that had given him so much is very similar to the same duty to give back which Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, and many others have pledged to do as a part of <a href=\"http://givingpledge.org/%29\" target=\"_blank\">The Giving Pledge</a>. When you complete an accomplishment look for the opportunity to give back to others.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"<a href=\"http://www.eddiebauer.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Eddie Bauer</a> is undoubtedly one of America&#x2019;s most iconic brands, steeped in a rich history of adventure dating back nearly 100 years to its founder and namesake. This entrepreneurial outfitter was responsible for designing the first down parka, and outfitting the first Americans to summit Everest as well as pilots duing the U.S. Air Force in WWII. And in the &#x2018;90s, Ford released its limited edition Eddie Bauer Explorer.Although Eddie Bauer was the original American outfitter, after a number of owners, each with different expectations, the brand drifted from its core purpose in pursuit of growth. And its journey away from authentic outfitter to a catalog-centric brand offering stretch pants and accent pillows was part of its downfall. Add to this the arrival of laser-focused competitors like The North Face and Patagonia, and it suddenly became a battle for the outdoor outfitting space.Bulldog was hired by&#xA0;Golden Gate Capital and its new management team to help find the brand&#x2019;s authentic core and build a brand platform to serve as the foundation for revitalizing and rebuilding the brand. We worked closely with the Eddie Bauer leadership team to frame a clear picture of the future state of the business and a new vision, mission and values to drive them back to success.We spent countless hours in the company&#x2019;s archives and were inspired by the captivating story of Eddie Bauer&#x2019;s entrepreneurial inventiveness and his passion for the outdoors. From there, we knew that the Great Northwest and the brand&#x2019;s rich heritage with a modern translation had to play integral parts in the overarching brand platform.As we designed the brand platform, we created a visual story that highlights a love for adventure whether it be in the great outdoors or in your own backyard&#x2014;after all, true adventure can be found anywhere.We also explored a refreshed identity system. Inspired by other great American brands like Ralph Lauren, we set out to simplify and modernize the visual identity. We developed a more streamlined version of Eddie&#x2019;s original signature paired with a classic font to create a system of consistency and cohesion across all facets of the brand.The result is a brand with a newly defined sense of purpose and a newfound passion emanating from every department, every catalog spread, jacket detail and photo shoot. Our journey together reaffirmed Eddie Bauer&#x2019;s position in the world of adventure so they can continue outfitting America for the next 100 years.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "date":"December 06, 2018",
       "principle":"MASTER SIMPLICITY",
       "content_body":"Have you ever thought about how you sound? As individuals, it&#x2019;s a huge part of our make up and level of attractiveness. People are more likely to elicit an emotional response by reacting to sound versus visuals. Whether it&#x2019;s our accent, level of audibility, mumbling tendencies or tone, voices play a huge part in defining each and every one of us. Yet when folks walk into a meeting or head out for a social evening, they are much more concerned with their appearances. Not surprisingly, people collectively spend billions of dollars on their looks, yet virtually nothing on how they sound. <br><br>But the power of voice is undeniable and helps to make us individuals. While some may choose to wear the exact same outfit as their neighbor, their sounds are never the same. Just as sound plays a role in defining people&#x2019;s personalities, it does the same for brands. Ninety percent of B2C CMOs say they believe that sound can strengthen their brands. Most of them are referring to music and tone of voice in social media video or commercials. But, they&#x2019;re leaving a lot on the table.<br><br>Harley Davidson is a great example of a brand that uses audio to differentiate. It consciously designs product audio, as heard in the distinctive roar of its bike engines. You don&#x2019;t have to be a biker to recognize a Harley&#x2019;s engine when it&#x2019;s in earshot but out of view. It&#x2019;s one of the most defining of the brand&#x2019;s associations. It helps to separate it from the pack.BMW is another brand that uses product sound. Perhaps not as defining as Harley Davidson, the manufacturer&#x2019;s exhaust system is tuned to a note of confidence, calm and unstated power. It&#x2019;s a precision sound for a precision brand. BMW even takes time to ensure the sounds of its car doors are distinct when being closed.I recently sat in a fast food restaurant surrounded by all types of sounds&#x2014;from the chatter of families with kids loudly slurping soda through straws, to the hiss of cooking and the horrendously overpowering soda dispenser&#x2019;s cooling fan. Somewhere in the cacophony was the sound of Beyonc&#xE9; belting out &#x201C;Crazy&#x201D;. But while the song and playlist from which it came may have been carefully selected to appeal to the customer demo (although probably unlikely), the restaurant experience was not defined by the music. It was defined by a horrific imbalance of audio. The overall impact of the combined sounds had not been considered, and one had to presume the same applied to the company&#x2019;s other 1,200 restaurants across the nation. It was an afterthought. Imagine if this huge chain actually stopped to actively think about how to blend the combined sounds in its restaurants. It could be very powerful.Every brand has a sound, but does it add to its allure or does it impact it negatively? Think about this. Why would a brand spend money and time ensuring creative visuals are on brand but not a second thought about sound? Sound shouldn&#x2019;t be ignored. The audience is always listening.<br><br><strong>Some Uncommon Sense Learnings</strong>&#xA0;<em>Read more from <a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/author/dave-alder#filters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dave</a>.</em><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

So she set out to find a better way to make&#xA0;fresh, healthy pet food.

Rooted&#xA0;authentically in the yoga community,&#xA0;they&#x2019;ve quietly grown from a&#xA0;fledgling concept to a passion-based brand with a fanatical following. Their&#xA0;first real store opened in Vancouver, BC in 2000 and their idea&#xA0;was a simple&#xA0;one: be a community hub where people can learn about the physical&#xA0;aspects of healthy living from yoga, diet, running, cycling and the mental&#xA0;aspects of&#xA0;living an active lifestyle. Every week, Lululemon stores move&#xA0;their products aside, unroll yoga mats and turn their spaces into pop-up yoga&#xA0;studios. Classes are&#xA0;complimentary and are lead by instructors from&#xA0;local studios in the community. The staff at Lululemon&#xA0;reflects the lifestyle of the brand authentically,&#xA0;which most retail brands&#xA0;struggle with and, in so doing, effortlessly attract the type of consumers who&#xA0;shop and work out there. Lululemon Athletica combines the purpose and&#xA0;passion of the people they serve at the center of their brand experience,&#xA0;and from the outside they make it look effortless.Create pure product love.

       "content_body":"Sharing unexpected love will make someone else&#x2019;s day, and probably yours as well.With the presidential election around the corner, there&#x2019;s a lot of focus on negativity and increasing hostility in the media. The news tends to publicize the bad over the good. But contrary to what&#x2019;s portrayed, the world is much more positive. Every day there are examples of people, companies, and causes doing good and here&#x2019;s one example in particular that touched us.<a href=\"http://promotegrace.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Promote Grace</a> is a passion project whose goal is to connect people in a more meaningful way by promoting random acts of kindness throughout the world. We recently had the opportunity to speak to Todd Purgason and Dr. <a href=\"http://markambrose.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Ambrose</a> about their project.&#xA0; &#xA0;<strong>Tell us about the project:</strong>This initiative was the result of our study as a church. We wanted to focus on grace and the gift of forgiveness, both of which are undeserved and unearned. Grace means that you receive something profound that you don&#x2019;t expect or deserve. It feels good to experience grace because it makes you feel loved. And it gives you a small glimpse of who you can be.In our study, it was clear that when we experience grace from others (i.e. random acts of kindness), it resonates deep within our souls. But it also provides a sample of what it could be like to experience God&#x2019;s saving grace. The Promote Grace project aims to create opportunities for people to experience the power of giving and receiving random acts of kindness.<strong>How does the program work?</strong>The way Promote Grace works is simple, a person demonstrates an act of grace towards someone else and then gives them a branded Promote Grace card. It&#x2019;s that easy, no dialog or interaction needs to take place. And depending on the act, this can be done with total confidentiality. Our only goal is that a card be given. Hopefully, the experience will create a curiosity that prompts people to log onto the website where they can discover a more in-depth look into grace and all it has to offer. The goal is for people to make the connection between what they experienced and the opportunity to also experience or learn about God&#x2019;s ultimate act of grace.<strong>What makes the project unique?</strong>Often the idea of religion can feel uncomfortable or awkward. We believe this is why most people today don&#x2019;t openly discuss faith. As a result, evangelism becomes a guilt driven topic rather than a blessing, and few step into participating in it.&#xA0;Promote Grace offers an opportunity to discuss religion in a new and exciting way. It isn&#x2019;t uncomfortable to do something kind for someone else. It is a blessing and people are happy to receive kindness. At the same time, when a Promote Grace card is given, it points to religion in a very non-threatening way. No awkward discussion needs to take place. In fact, it is better if nothing is said at all other than &#x201C;check out the website.&#x201D;We believe this program can transform the way we approach religion and the way we engage others to participate.<strong>Who supports the project and why?</strong>Promote Grace was launched by Pacific Coast Church, but we designed it with the hope that other churches will get involved and use our website as a resource. We hope our efforts will spread to a national level and we plan to partner with other churches and help them promote grace in their areas as well. We provide free media kits online that include artwork for people to print their own cards and stickers.<strong>&#xA0;</strong><strong>The best part about collaborating with others:</strong>It is important that churches work together. We are excited about this opportunity and look forward to bringing positive experiences to people regardless of their beliefs.<strong>How can people get involved?</strong>It&#x2019;s simple! Visit our website <a href=\"http://promotegrace.com/inspiration/\" target=\"_blank\">Promote Grace</a> and explore how it works and what people have experienced. We&#x2019;ve provided a four-step process that simply says:A solid purpose and a meaningful mission can move mountains. We&#x2019;re excited to see how this project helps connect people and spread kindness.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"This is the irrefutable lesson of open systems, and an important key to understanding trends in your life.First let me establish the basic parts of an open system so I can easily refer to them throughout this post. An open system is any complex thing like a plant, animal, or organization. In each of these systems, there are sub-systems that interact among themselves&#x2014;like breathing and blood flow, the sub-systems have <em>components</em> that do stuff (like lungs pulling oxygen from air), <em>inputs </em>to the system (like air), and <em>outputs</em> of the system (like bad breath). Inputs frequently have an impact on the outputs (like eating garlic), but sometimes are unrelated.It&#x2019;s important to remember that the environment surrounding a system changes over time, causing the system to deal with those changes by either adapting or ceasing to work. This circumstance is the basis of the statement, &#x201C;grow or die.&#x201D; Other words for growth might be adapt or evolve, but growth has the nice connotation of positive change and forward progress, so I like it better. What might be a good source of supply to a system today could totally disappear tomorrow, causing a complete breakdown of the system (like how jumping into a pool removes access to air for your lungs).Or perhaps the inputs contain elements that are good and necessary (like oxygen) but also contain things that are harmful (like cigarette smoke or asbestos). Our lungs are able to process the good things and keep our bodies functioning well, but gradually the bad things reduce that capacity or grow into negative subsystems like cancer. Oxygen helps our bodies grow in size and capacity, but the negative elements reduce or limit that growth in trade-offs between good and bad.So now let&#x2019;s consider the idea of <em>growth over time</em> and science (i.e. the study of millions of open systems), and the S-Curve. The S-Curve is often referred to as the Growth Curve because the vertical axis represents the change in size, volume, or some other capacity as time moves forward on the horizontal axis. Consider this chart showing the growth of bacteria in several phases. In many open systems the stationary and decline stages stretch out over a long period of time and look more like a wave. There are alternating periods of growth and decline as the system adjusts to environmental changes like food or some other important input.<a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Chart.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4040\" title=\"Chart\" src=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Chart.jpg\" alt width=\"395\" height=\"320\"></a>Humans can grow in so many different ways it&#x2019;s hard to keep track of them all. Our bodies grow physically from birth to adult maturity and ultimately death. Our relationships grow from inception (did she just wink at me?) to maturity or demise. Our understanding of the world grows from simple pattern recognition as babies begin to understand speech to complex reasoning and philosophical imagination as graduate students or senior researchers. Together these aspects of being human combine to indicate our growth as a person. A simple way to group them all is Mind, Body, and Spirit, remembering that these categories are interdependent not operating on separate tracks.It&#x2019;s pretty easy to understand how the growth curve applies to the Body aspects of our lives. As babies, we start out tiny and grow exponentially rather quickly until we become adult sized. Then most of us alternate between being fatter and skinnier for the rest of our lives as we struggle with our food intake and exercise (output). It might be harder to notice, but this same scenario plays out in our Mind and Spirit aspects as well.The learning sub-system of us humans has components like your brain, your senses, and your emotions. It has inputs like data, knowledge, information, advice, opinions, and sensory stimuli (like heat, texture, etc.). And it has outputs like behavior, action, habit, opinion, advice and insight. None of these examples is a complete list, but hopefully you get the point.As babies and children we learn rapidly by taking in billions of data points and bits of information through their eyes and ears. Then as students we read and listen and study to take in facts and information to deepen our understanding of the world. Even as young professionals we still have to learn quickly to develop practical skills and insights about our chosen area of work. After decades of constant learning we start to stabilize and gradually decline as our experience gets stale and the world around us starts to move on to new ideas and practices that we haven&#x2019;t kept up with along the way. We even call this aging process being &#x201C;over the hill&#x201D; which I think aptly describes tipping over to decline phase on the curve.For nearly 800 generations of human history (about 60,000 years), our lifetime learning curve mapped pretty well to our lifetime body curve. As we got older and started to decline physically, we could also retire and decline mentally. The world around us wasn&#x2019;t changing all that much so we didn&#x2019;t really have to &#x201C;relearn&#x201D; anything in order to be at the top of the curve in a relatively stable phase.But not any more!According to Alvin Toffler in his seminal book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Future-Shock-Alvin-Toffler/dp/0553277375\">Future Shock</a>, we passed an inflection point in the rate of change in human culture towards the end of the last century. At that point, people had to start relearning things and adapting to changes in our world or start falling behind rapidly. Past the inflection point of technological change, we can no longer count on things we learned in childhood being true anymore. We have to recheck things as science and technology advance human understanding and practices to new levels at an increasing rate of speed.When my grandmother was born, people couldn&#x2019;t fly. When she died, there had been men on the moon. When I was a kid, there was a planet called Pluto. Now it&#x2019;s not considered a planet anymore. The periodic table I memorized in high school had 106 elements; now it has 118. My own kids have already seen unbelievable environmental changes in their lives resulting from mobile phones morphing into powerful computers with cameras. My mom has an iPad and is the most active person on Facebook I know. The technology makes it easier to connect with friends and family scattered all over world. She doesn&#x2019;t have to sit in her kitchen and wait for people to stop by, they can play Words With Friends together in different time zones and she can dial them up on video chat to see their smiling faces. Instead of wishing for the &#x201C;old times&#x201D; and falling behind, she has learned new ways to interact and grown healthier as a result.Toffler called the problem of relearning &#x201C;shock&#x201D; because adults were not prepared for rapid change and felt we would suffer in our reactions to it. The Baby Boomers may have been shocked, but I think people coming of age today are ready for constant change. Our great ability to understand the world is a natural and agile open system. The inputs may have changed, but our ability to process them into create outputs is very resilient.Breathe!If you are thrown into a pool, you have to hold your breath while you are under water or else you will drown. But once you realize you are in a pool, you come up for air and start to swim (or quickly learn how!). This sink or swim reaction is a perfect example of grow or die. So don&#x2019;t hold your breath and hope the world will stop changing&#x2014;take a breath and engage with all that is new around you so you can move up the curve not down it.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

Poor, nonexistent, misdirected and dysfunctional communication are among the biggest reasons companies fail to accomplish their missions. Building a strong culture takes countless hours, hard work and commitment&#x2013;&#x2013;and often involves tearing down the barriers that threaten success. Identifying ways to optimize internal communication is an area that leaders should invest more time in.Working closely with a diverse range of executive teams at both multi-billion dollar corporations and early-stage startups, I work as a strategic guide around strategy, innovation and cultural transformation and I have seen how collaboration and communication at its best drives success and at its worst, poisons a company&#x2019;s potential. Significant investment is made in employee development, recognition and engagement but very little time and money is spent to improve communication.Be honest for a minute and think about how much time you waste in meeting preparation to ensure you deliver on a message for a key executive. Or how much analysis and discussion revolves around trying to understand and translate feedback from a senior leader&#x2013;&#x2013;it adds up and is riddled with inefficiency.Maybe it&#x2019;s time to think about internal communication as an opportunity for new thinking.&#xA0;Understanding who you&#x2019;re talking to, how they process information and like to communicate are opportunities to significantly improve results.Chances are your employees don&apos;t always have the opportunity to perform at their optimum because their natural talents go untapped as a result of poor communication and a lack of understanding of who they&#x2019;re engaging. In our work to connect teams and optimize their cultural effectiveness, we&#x2019;ve used two programs that have been very effective in improving communication.<strong><a href=\"http://strengths.gallup.com/default.aspx\"><u>Strength</u>s Finder</a></strong> is a valuable engagement tool that helps employees discover and build their innate abilities. The Gallup created assessment program is based on a 40-year study of human strengths and talents&#x2014;helping people ingress, discover and characterize their talents. They&#x2019;ve also created an online <a href=\"https://www.gallupstrengthscenter.com\">Strengths Center</a> to enhance strength solutions to be more engaged, more productive, and happier. When people do what they do best, companies and organizations benefit. &#x201C;People who use their strengths every day are six times more likely to be engaged on the job. Teams that focus on their strengths are 12.5% more productive. Coach the people you lead to improve their performance.&#x201D; <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/services/176321/clifton-strengthsfinder-technical-report-development-validation.aspx?utm_source=Teams%20that%20focus%20on%20their%20strengths%20are%2012.5%25%20more&amp;utm_medium=search&amp;utm_campaign=tiles\">&#x2013;Gallup</a>The program also enhances executive leadership teams by focusing on leadership talents. Completing Gallup&#x2019;s strengths coaching certification process allows individuals to achieve an elite level of coaching and mentorship by providing them with the tools to inspire confidence among the people they coach.&#xA0;<a href=\"http://paulamulford.com/topics/whos-who-in-the-zoo/\">Who&#x2019;s Who in the Zoo</a> is another program designed to enhance internal communication. It transforms the way people in companies relate to one another, to management and to customers by teaching them to become effective communicators. Personality types are easily identified and referenced with a specific animal characteristic. Once participants are aware of their personal <a href=\"http://paulamulford.com/topics/whos-who-in-the-zoo/\">character</a>, they learn how it relates to their own communication styles. They are also taught how to intentionally adapt their communication style to more effectively listen to, connect with, and influence their important colleagues.This program works because it&#x2019;s structured to focus on others instead of one&#x2019;s own self and is built on the premise that successful communication is saying something the way the other person can hear it, not the way you want to say it<strong>. </strong>The program begins with people discovering which animal they are in the zoo, and once that&#x2019;s established, the focus shifts to others, adapting the ideal communication style accordingly.Good communication is key in business and in life&#x2013;&#x2013;yet it is absent in many relationships, teams and companies. Utilizing communication-enhancing tools is an effective way to improve executive leadership, build team and interpersonal communication, develop employee strengths and innate talents, all while helping to increase productivity and build a vibrant company culture.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"My dad used to say you can&#x2019;t put an old head on young shoulders. I didn&#x2019;t agree with that back then, but now I know what he meant. Life is a journey, and along the way it presents us with particularly large or salient milestones that shake us up or wake us up in ways we may not have anticipated. Turning fifty was one of those milestones for me. It has made me rather reflective on my life up to this point, and especially contemplative about what I want life to look like going forward. But if there&#x2019;s anything that we can hope to gain on this wild ride called life, it&#x2019;s some sort of wisdom that we can only find with experience and time. So in the spirit of reflection, at fifty, here is some of what I think I know.<strong>1.&#xA0;Love something enough that you&#x2019;re prepared to make big sacrifices.</strong>Back in 1991 I came to the United States with two suitcases, $10,000 and a heart full of love. I left everything I knew to follow the love of my life, my wife of 25 years. My life has been better than I could have ever imagined as a result. Not always easy, but absolutely beautiful nonetheless.There&#x2019;s a lot of talk about finding and doing what you&#x2019;re passionate about, but it seems to me that our passion or love for someone or something should be measured by the amount we&#x2019;re willing to sacrifice for them. Whether you agree or disagree, if you don&#x2019;t love something enough that you are prepared to make big sacrifices for it, you should probably think again. And on the flip side, if you are making big sacrifices for something that you don&#x2019;t love or at the expense of the people you love, ask yourself why. Is it worth it?<strong>2. Life is not a bowl of cherries, so surround yourself with really good people.</strong>Here&#x2019;s the deal. Life is going to throw some sh*t at you. Some will get their fair share and some will get a whole lot more than they bargained for. There&#x2019;s no getting around that. The best thing that you can do to prepare for the sh*t is to surround yourself with people who enrich your life &#x2013; people who support you, who can teach you something, who care about you and who know when to listen to you, but also when to lovingly give you a kick in the ass. Pick the inner circle of people whom you trust, your friends, mentors, and advisors, wisely and with great care.<strong>3. Your <strike>reputation</strike> character is everything.</strong>Do the right thing even when no one is looking. Do what&#x2019;s right because it&#x2019;s right, not because you are concerned with your reputation. Reputation is absolutely important, but it should always be a result of your character &#x2013; and real character is doing what&#x2019;s right even when others will fault you for it. Dare to stand up for your values despite the criticism you may face. Not many have the guts to risk sacrificing their reputation for upholding their character, especially in business and politics. But reputation should never be the end goal &#x2013; that&apos;s&#xA0;inauthentic at best and utterly toxic at worst. Live for character instead. I am confident that it will always pay off, even if it takes some time.<strong>4. Treat other people the way <em>they</em> want to be treated.</strong>Technically, the golden rule is, &#x201C;Treat other people the way you want to be treated.&#x201D; Not bad advice, but it&#x2019;s slightly misguided. It turns out that not everyone wants to be treated the same way that you do. Love people the way that <em>they</em> want to be loved. Take the time to understand how they want to be treated, rather than assuming that you know better. Empathy, after all, is putting yourself in another person&#x2019;s shoes, not forcing them into yours and expecting them to fit. Lose yourself in service to others by learning how to best love and serve them the way that they need.&#xA0;<strong>5.&#xA0;Life is not a dress rehearsal.</strong>Life is the real deal, you don&#x2019;t get another go around. Time is the most valuable currency you have, far more than money, though our culture would like to convince us otherwise, so spend it wisely. We are all going to have to spend a good chunk of our lives working, and like I mentioned before, if you love with your whole heart, you will certainly have to make some sacrifices in your life. But never forget that you can&#x2019;t get time spent back. So make sure that you are spending your time working for something worthwhile, sacrificing for those you love, and soaking up every moment as best you can, even the crap ones. Because it&#x2019;s all part of the journey.<strong>6. Just f*cking do it.</strong>Don&#x2019;t sit around waiting for the right time to make a move or hoping that life will hand you everything that you dream of. Go after it. And don&#x2019;t let any voice, including your own, tell you that you can&#x2019;t do something. Life is too short for that nonsense. If something is important to you, let your actions reflect it. And don&#x2019;t let the two other F words &#x2013; fear and failure &#x2013; get in your way. Embrace them and channel them into growth and strength.It turns out that my dad was right when he said you can&#x2019;t put an old head on young shoulders. Wisdom earned with experience is inevitably more transformative than wisdom simply repeated from others. Wisdom is only our own when we have put it into practice. We all have to forge our own paths in life, and that means making our own mistakes and learning the lessons that are unique to the areas in which we need to grow. But in forging our own paths, it serves us well to listen to the wisdom of those who have gone before us. Because if you can apply their wisdom to your life, it will eventually become your wisdom too.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

It&#x2019;s never about them, but rather about the people they serve.<strong>Great coaches model growth and lead beside a person.</strong> Great coaches first become clear and vulnerable in their own leadership practice to be able to share where they get stuck. This builds trust through authentic connection.Vulnerability requires constant self-reflection. Consider how you inspire, how you challenge, and what actions, emotions and characteristics you lead with.Ask yourself:The goal of coaching is to provide &#x201C;Interactions that help the coachee expand awareness, discover creative solutions and implement better decisions,&#x201D; &#x2013;<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackzenger/2017/09/07/7-tips-for-coaching-someone-more-experienced-than-you/&amp;refURL=&amp;referrer=#5d395d1f7741\">Jack Zenger</a>. In order to free up a client to take new action, coaches must first be very clear with themselves by asking:A great coach isn&#x2019;t solving on behalf of the coachee, but serves as a facilitator of self-reflection and creative problem-solving. So, a coach needs to first be very clear about their own current leadership stance.After building and exercising a routine of self-reflection for personal clarity, the next step is to determine the purpose of the coaching conversation. Is the goal of the discussion for short-term performance improvement or long-term career development? Both are crucial, but each requires a different strategy.<strong><u>Coaching for Now</u></strong>In a performance conversation, questions should be directed to getting the coachee to see the importance and urgency of the recent lack of performance. Then, guide him or her to better solutions that propel better results. As a rule of thumb, avoid &#x2018;Why&#x2019; questions, these don&#x2019;t fuel productive or future-oriented conversations.<strong>Step 1: Understand.</strong> When you start a coaching conversation about recent performance, begin by getting aligned so you&#x2019;re on the same page about the importance and urgency of the matter. Here are some retrospective questions to use:Allow the coachee to answer free. If you and the coachee don&#x2019;t see the issue with the same urgency, be assertive and ask questions to help him see the role of his work in the context of the organization.<strong>Step 2: Push. </strong>Halfway through the conversation, pivot to start challenging him to take responsibility going forward.<strong>Step 3: Encourage. </strong>Toward the end of the conversation, ensure the coachee feels positive and supported by your efforts to hold him or her accountable for action.&#xA0;<strong><u>Coaching for Later</u></strong>To balance out short-term performance improvement, a coaching conversation about a person&#x2019;s career is vital. In this type of conversation, use questions that focus on intrinsic motivation and practical skill development.<strong>Step 1:&#xA0; Open</strong> by asking some questions that make the coachee think about his or her values and how they see themselves as a growing leader:<strong>Step 2:&#xA0; Focus </strong>on what he&#x2019;s already great at and extend the application of those strengths to new responsibilities by asking:<strong>Step 3:&#xA0; Commit</strong> to next steps on developing capacity and experience that activate both strengths and motivation for the individual by asking:Bottom line: effective coaching starts with a clear coach. Whether you&#x2019;re coaching for immediate performance improvement or long-term career development, always keep in mind that a coach&#x2019;s job is to lead from beside, not above.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"<em>&#x201C;Hard times arouse an instinctive desire for authenticity.&#x201D;</em> -Coco ChanelThe question &#x201C;are you for real?&#x201D; is poignant. It&#x2019;s a question that the world&#x2019;s greatest brands are asking themselves more today than any other time in history. And consumers, who might be the most discerning generation to-date, are also exploring this question before committing to purchases&#x2014;large or small. Many attribute this judicious shift in mindset to a handful of critical events. Largely responsible is our recent economic downturn and its residual cleansing effects. Many great learnings and accountabilities have emerged for brands to put into practice&#x2014;the most important is a new and unrequited consumer hunger for one prerequisite that seems quite obvious and simple&#x2014;authenticity.Authenticity is a precarious descriptor. Brands earn authenticity over time through consistency in communication, actions and their products &amp; services. Similar to cowboys, brands that have earned this esteemed honor never state that they are &#x201C;authentic&#x201D; because they don&#x2019;t need to.Work Hard, Play Hard. While every country has an inherent mantra that helps drive its culture&#x2014;Knights of the Roundtable in England, Ninja Warriors in Japan&#x2014;the US embraces its cowboys and the West.The life and role of a cowboy is rarely celebrated in today&#x2019;s modern age, yet they have secured their heroic reputation because they stand fiercely for something: the simple, basic values that lie at the heart of the cowboy way. While innovation has brought widespread change over the past 150 years, the cowboy and his lifestyle have undergone very little variation&#x2014;their foundation of hard work, tenacity and integrity continue to serve as the hallmark for those who honor and live by their authentic code. Cowboys continue to be a source of inspiration to do better and be better at all times, and their maxims hold the power to impact individuals, groups, businesses, governments and even countries who adopt their social code.Writer Jim Owen&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://cowboyethics.org\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Cowboy Ethics</em> </a>extracts the relentless rectitude from the historic and unwritten common morals of the Code of the West and turns them into an uncommon and modern directive. As he states, &#x201C;Wall Street could learn a great deal from a set of values that are based on hard work and integrity.&#x201D; Frankly, Owen&#x2019;s <em>Cowboy Ethics</em> serves as a tool for contemporary brands to use as guide to validate their own paths to authenticity.The cowboy values sit very close to my heart. They also bring to mind a uniquely rare brand that&#x2019;s as authentic as a true American cowboy&#x2014;<a href=\"http://www.kingssaddlery.com\" target=\"_blank\">King&#x2019;s Saddlery</a>, a nearly 70-year old family business owned and operated in a small Northern Wyoming town&#x2014;population 17,000. Started by Don King, this tack shop specializes in custom rope and saddle-making and has earned a level of authenticity that most brands spend an entire lifetime trying to achieve. Don stood true to his personal mission of devoting himself and the lives of his family &#x201C;to bettering the Western way of life&#x201D; through his brand. Generations of Kings have taken the baton and throughout the decades stayed proudly dedicated to Don&#x2019;s directive.Recently King&#x2019;s Ropes began to lasso a larger consumer-base as the label blossomed into a lifestyle brand. King&#x2019;s hat business has made a Taylor-Swift-like crossover from pure cowboy to an impressive tender-footed surf, pop and hipster culture brand. This occurrence was unintentional and not driven by the organization, as it has no active social media platform and only rallies around old school word of mouth. In a conversation with Don King&#x2019;s son, Bruce King, he stated that the brand does not market to, or work directly with, the new counter-culture consumer. And while it may not be obvious to the King&#x2019;s management team, it is apparent why consumers are so smitten with his brand.As Bruce and I talked about the brand and its history, I commended him on the organization&#x2019;s inviolable reputation as &#x201C;the world&#x2019;s best rope maker and tack shop&#x201D;. Bruce politely made it very clear that the claim, <em>the best in the world</em>, has never been made by the company itself&#x2014;&#x201C;this is what our consumers tell us, that we&#x2019;re the best in the world in the work that we do, the products we provide and the service we offer.&#x201D; Bruce shared, &#x201C;We are humbled, proud and honored to be able to continue extending our precious family crafts to those who need and use them most.&#x201D;I found a Facebook page called <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/KingRopesHat\" target=\"_blank\">King Ropes Hat</a>, that is managed by a King&#x2019;s fanatic who makes it clear that he&#x2019;s not associated with the company and directs sales questions to the King&#x2019;s website. The brand loyalist says that he is a King&#x2019;s hat lover and wanted to create a venue for other loyal fans to share their love for the brand. I asked him to post a question for their 11,000-people following, &#x201C;Why do you love King&#x2019;s hats?&#x201D; and the responses flooded in from all around the world.Here are just a few of the comments to my query:<em>King&#x2019;s are ropes made by cowboys for cowboys. They have tradition and quality behind them. The hats represent the store and its heritage and what it stands for.&#xA0;</em><em>I grew up a spoiled child thinking that every tack store looked like King&#x2019;s. Boy did I get a rude awaking the first time I went into another store. That cap represents the cowboy ethics that I grew up with in Wyoming, around some of the best horsemen and mighty fine craftsmen.</em><em>Grandad gave me my first rope when I was a young boy. Told me King&#x2019;s was the only way to go. He was right.&#xA0;</em><em>The reason why people love King&#x2019;s, SIMPLE&#x2014;it&apos;s because without them where would all the cowboys be?</em><em> Once you put your King&#x2019;s hat on, you immediately go back to your roots and heritage! Plus, it&apos;s fun to walk down the street and people think you&apos;re from the Wild West!&#xA0;</em><em>This brand&#x2019;s journey and its consumer dedication is an impressive honor for a small store in downtown<a href=\"http://www.sheridanwy.net/\">&#xA0;Sheridan</a>, Wyoming.&#xA0;If you are a cowboy in Wyoming, you shop at King&#x2019;s. And thanks to the power of the internet, if you&#x2019;re a cowboy (or simply inspired by one) nearly anywhere in the world, you also shop at King&#x2019;s. If you&#x2019;re lucky enough to make it to the store you can also capture a bit of their history as you walk through the Don King museum located in a separate building behind the store&#x2014;of course free and one of the many areas the family gives back within the community.</em>If you&#x2019;re looking for solid guardrails to check your brand&#x2019;s directive, Owen&#x2019;s<em> <a href=\"http://cowboyethics.org\" target=\"_blank\">Cowboy Ethics</a></em> is a fantastic starting point. The ethics he outlines will help assess your brand through a unique lens, and through the process further cultivate robust values and ethics, find your brand&#x2019;s inner cowboy&#x2014;pointing your brand towards longstanding authenticity.Cowboy Ethics:1.

       "content_body":"Michael Morrow was packing his office wrapping up a decade as a successful Creative Director at Nike. It just so happened that his Nike departure was a couple days before the annual football game between Oregon State and Oregon. &#xA0;Known to locals as the Civil War, this one was especially weighty as it matched the #5 and #8 teams in the polls.&#xA0;A soon to be former colleague (and Ducks fan) walked into his office and said he thought it&#x2019;d be a good game. For Morrow, who grew up in Oregon State&#x2019;s hometown&#x2014;he calls it <em>&#x201C;Corvallis, Center of the Universe&#x201D;</em>&#xA0;&#x2014;good wasn&#x2019;t quite the way he felt about it. He jumped up and expressed his opinion a little more forcefully of domination by the Beavers. And then he went to join his family for dinner. While at dinner, he thought about stuff to wear to the game. On a napkin, he sketched out the design of a helmet in Oregon State colors with a Mohawk of spikes and a few ducks impaled on them.&#x201C;A buddy gave me a black skateboard helmet so I could make it. The glue had barely dried by game time,&#x201D; Morrow said, &#x201C;but I wore the helmet anyway and it got a great reaction.&#x201D; That sparked some searching. He took a look at the helmet category and saw a couple different angles: technical cycling helmets focused on performance attributes and functional helmets mostly in black. &#x201C;Basically, there were bike geek styles that serious cyclists would wear and basic helmets for kids. They were all boring and none had personality.&#x201D;He kept thinking about his helmet idea while he spent a few years building a creative agency for clients like ESPN and Disney. He finally concluded that if he could produce helmets with cool designs then people would be more likely to wear them&#x2026;and buy them.&#x201C;At Nike, we sold a lot of hats with logos and teams on them but there was nothing like that for bike helmets.&#x201D;&#xA0;All along, Morrow built relationships. He&#x2019;s the sort of character who quickly establishes rapport with people and comes across as someone to be trusted with an honest opinion and a genuine nature. &#x201C;I grew up on sports fields. Me and my friends learned pretty quick that we needed each other in order to win and we also did better when we said what was on our minds. We could be up front without being obnoxious. And it was all in a spirit of doing better next time out.&#x201D; He&#x2019;s tapped into those relationships to build Nutcase.&#xA0;<em><strong>A Specialty Brand that Started in Mass Retail&#x2026;</strong></em><br>Over time, Morrow focused more on his helmet ideas. He created the brand, <a href=\"http://www.nutcasehelmets.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Nutcase</a>, and the story. &#x201C;We wanted to make helmets fun. To make them into something you&#x2019;d want to wear without being told you should.&#x201D; &#xA0;So where would one try to start selling a product like that? &#xA0;A friend of Morrow&#x2019;s knew the buyer at Target so Morrow made samples and sent them in. &#x201C;I wasn&#x2019;t expecting them to take it but they loved the designs. And then I thought, uh oh, we&#x2019;re going to have to make them now.&#x201D; The initial helmets became a hot seller. The category leader, <a href=\"https://www.bellhelmets.com/cycling/\" target=\"_blank\">Bell Helmets</a>, rolled out their version of cool graphics within the first year. Target also came out with a store brand helmet. Meanwhile, Walmart picked up Nutcase too. &#xA0;Even though he&#x2019;d started in mass retail, Morrow was considering what would be the best channel to aim for. &#xA0;Always willing to ask for opinion, he packed up samples for a specialty line of helmets and had a chat with <a href=\"http://www.bikegallery.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bike Gallery</a> in Portland. &#xA0;&#x201C;I really wanted to know how they thought Nutcase would do in bike shops.&#x201D; After Bike Gallery gave an enthusiastic green light, Nutcase signed up a few other leading bike shops and had a go. &#xA0;As those close to specialty retail know, a brand attempting to pivot from mass retail distribution to specialty is an unusual and bold move. It&#x2019;s also the opposite of what usually happens. Target and Walmart have 6,500 stores in the US. There are 3,800 specialty bike shops&#x2026;85% of which are single location businesses. &#xA0;Along with the fragmentation of the channel, customer margin and support requirements are different and that requires a different go to market strategy. There&#x2019;s also a long-standing resentment from specialty retailers toward mass. Crossing that chasm isn&#x2019;t easy nor&#x2014;in most cases&#x2014;advisable. Nonetheless, Nutcase did it. &#xA0;Understandably, it took a few years to get going. Despite the temptation to utilize distributors upon their entry into specialty retail, Nutcase initially used a handful of independent reps in key markets. They did bring their own merchandising angle. &#xA0;Bike helmets were typically stacked on shelves in their original boxes. &#xA0;Nutcase wanted visibility so they offered free branded helmet hooks so consumers could see their products on the wall. &#xA0;And Morrow&#x2019;s sportswear background came through in their thinking. &#x201C;I wanted us to think like a T-shirt company and keep coming out with designs,&#x201D; he said. His hope was to sell more product and also be harder to chase. &#x201C;Since we were competing with big companies, all these new designs would be a problem to them. A few pennies to us didn&#x2019;t matter but to a big company spreading that out over their supply chain would add up. Why would some big company CFO want to chase a small design group in Portland?&#x201D;<em><strong>Using International Distribution to Fuel Domestic&#x2026;</strong></em><br>And then a German kid saw Nutcase at a US trade show and told them about an opportunity that would inspire the company to (again) make an unconventional move. &#xA0;<a href=\"http://munich.ispo.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\">ISPO</a>, the giant sporting goods and athletic show in Munich, had a section devoted to innovative new brands. &#x201C;They had a contest for a free spot in their &#x2018;Brand New Village,&#x2019;&#x201D; said Morrow. &#x201C;We submitted and won a spot.&#x201D; &#xA0;ISPO also had a runway show with athletic models sporting items from the new brands. Suddenly, Nutcase&#x2019;s cool factor became very visible at the show. &#xA0;&#x201C;We were pounded with interested distributors,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;So we set up a master distributor in Europe and got rolling.&#x201D; Pretty quickly, international sales were far bigger than US. For a number of years, international represented 75% of their overall turnover. That also helped alleviate cash flow issues as European customers were making a down payment in advance of production and then paying Nutcase&#x2019;s suppliers directly before shipment. &#x201C;For us, it was a run to daylight&#x2026;we were going where the money was,&#x201D; according to Morrow. &#xA0;They were also learning about consumer appeal of their products. In countries with a high design ethos and bike helmets are worn regularly like Belgium, Denmark, and Japan, Nutcase does well. &#x201C;Denmark was our first real country distributer. The Danes live on bikes, wear helmets, and like to look good,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;They ate up Nutcase helmets from Day 1. They&#x2019;d line up outside stores like they were waiting for doughnuts.&#x201D;Nutcase then built distribution in Australia, Canada, and Japan among others. International distribution can complicate business for some companies. For Nutcase, the rapid growth and payment circumstances helped feed their growth in the US. &#xA0;<em><strong>Using patience and a lot of work to build the US&#x2026;</strong></em><br>Over time, the company patched together a network of independent reps to crack into independent bike shops. &#xA0;&#x201C;Just like with our international business, we found that certain areas cared more about design and we sold well in those areas. We tended to be more appealing in urban areas than in suburbs.&#x201D;&#xA0;Nutcase is now available in more than 1,000 independent specialty stores in the US as well as <a href=\"https://www.rei.com/search.html?q=nutcase+helmets&amp;origin=web&amp;ir=q%3Anutcase+helmets&amp;page=1\" target=\"_blank\">REI</a>. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re a little like Led Zeppelin which made it big abroad before growing in the UK where they&#x2019;re from. &#xA0;We&#x2019;re doing well and have lots of opportunities ahead.&#x201D;Michael Morrow, Scott Montgomery, the Nutcase family, and friends have built a unique brand and business. &#xA0;Here are a few lessons from their success that apply to businesses in other categories:Original post on the <a href=\"http://www.bottlerocketadvisors.com/bottle-rocket-blog/2017/4/24/beyond-the-swoosh-how-beavers-ducks-led-to-the-creation-of-a-quirky-successful-sports-brand\" target=\"_blank\">BottleRockAdvisors Blog</a>.&#xA0;<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

Over the course of the conversation, Libin conceded that Evernote had so many features that it was often difficult to explain to newcomers.</span>&quot;What winds up happening at Evernote conferences is that people go and they say, &#x2018;Oh, I love Evernote and I&#x2019;ve been using it for years and now I realize I&#x2019;ve only been using it for 5 percent of what it can do, and the problem is that it&#x2019;s a different 5 percent for everyone. If everyone just found the same 5 percent, then we&#x2019;d just cut the other 95 percent and save ourselves a lot of money. It&#x2019;s a very broad usage base.&quot;<span class=\"s1\">O&#x2019;Brien coins this issue &#x201C;the 5% problem,&#x201D; and it couldn&#x2019;t be more spot-on. Around the same time, BodeTree was going through something very similar. If you surveyed our users (and we did, frequently), you&#x2019;d find that everyone had a different perception of the core value that BodeTree provided. While every feature held value, there were so many that we struggled to present a cohesive view of what BodeTree was.</span><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Learning to say no</strong></span><span class=\"s1\">My team and I never set out to build a feature-heavy product. Our problem was that early on we were afraid to say no to potential clients and partners. We were largely an unproven product, and when an attractive partner asked for a feature we often obliged. This approach, of course, led to costly overruns and a somewhat bloated product.</span><span class=\"s1\">Eventually, the team and I gained enough confidence and traction to begin to say no to unnecessary feature requests that came our way. It wasn&#x2019;t easy because we still desired to please everyone that we encountered, but over time it paid off. We focused our efforts on refining our core experience. As we did, it became far easier to explain what the product did and how it would benefit our potential clients.</span><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Making a choice</strong></span><span class=\"s1\">If you&#x2019;re an entrepreneur who struggles with the 5% problem, fear not. You can fix your situation quickly, just as we did at BodeTree. The first step is to learn to say no. The next step, however, is to make a choice. Entrepreneurs must decide on what their core experience is and commit to it. At BodeTree, we decided to focus on solving the challenge faced by small businesses by automatically organizing banking transactions into financial accounting.</span><span class=\"s1\">Once you reaffirm your commitment to your product&#x2019;s core experience, you can move to either eliminate or demote non-core features. We eliminated numerous features, including roles, profiles, internal messaging, and various customizations. This decision streamlined our code base and dramatically improved our performance. &#xA0;</span><span class=\"s1\">The 5% problem that plagued both Evernote and BodeTree should never be underestimated or ignored. Only products with a clear focus and easy-to-understand value proposition can survive in today&#x2019;s crowded marketplace. Entrepreneurs must learn to say no to feature requests, no matter how painful it may be. From there, they must make a choice and focus on a single core experience and those features that support it. Only in doing so can companies overcome the 5% problem and thrive.&#xA0;</span>&#xA0;<span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/chris_myers_\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Myers </a>is the Cofounder and CEO of <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/www.bodetree.com\"><span class=\"s2\">BodeTree</span></a>, a web application designed to help small businesses manage their finances.</span><em><span class=\"s1\">Previously posted on <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/chrismyers/2016/01/08/if-you-cant-easily-explain-what-your-product-does-you-have-a-problem/#2715e4857a0b798f285b59c2\" target=\"_blank\">FORBES</a></span></em><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

From the widespread crony capitalism that weakened Wall Street to the stagnation in Washington DC, globalization and technology have disrupted America. And while some people are doing extremely well in the new era, there&#x2019;s an enormous empathy gap about what&#x2019;s really happening in middle America.&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/blkshpblkshp/info?tab=page_info\">BLK SHP</a>, a rapidly growing community of creative thinkers and doers, is gearing up for a socially focused cross-country bus trip this year called The BLK SHP Operation. Its focus is on the rediscovery of America in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century. BLK SHP believes we&#x2019;re in a time of reinvention and renewal and the group will support yearlong fellowships for talented entrepreneurs to partner with mayors throughout middle America to tackle social problems in new and creative ways.BLK SHP Operations have included socially-minded ventures throughout the UK like a trip to 10 Downing Street to visit with senior policy makers around innovation and social innovation and the launch of <a href=\"http://www.givingtuesday.org\">#GivingTuesday</a>, a global campaign to celebrate generosity and give something more.<strong>A creative approach to social entrepreneurship and social good <br></strong>BLK SHP is a tight-knit community of innovators, operating at the intersection of art, entrepreneurship and social good. The group came together with a vision for 2015 to tell the stories of how Americans are reinventing their lives and working together to renew their communities and towns. The tour will recognize and unlock creative opportunities in specific communities to transform them for the better.In a media world dominated by cynicism, BLK SHP hopes to inspire and inform America to rediscover its true north. Don&#x2019;t expect a heroic leader riding in on a white horse, but rather a phenomenal collection of everyday Americans tinkering and creating new ways to live and work.<strong>Unlocking creative opportunities that transform communities for the better<br></strong>During the months of April and May, BLK SHP will journey into the once prosperous Rust Belt&#x2014;traveling the cornfields of Missouri, Nebraska, and Kansas and making their way through Oklahoma, the Mississippi delta, the backwaters of Alabama, and the Rust Belts of Ohio, Pittsburg, and Detroit.Following the same pioneering spirit as John Steinbeck in <em>Travels with Charley</em>, The BLK SHP will help people focus on becoming a part of the collaboration of innovators who aim to impact change nationally by establishing 5&#x2013;10 <a href=\"http://fusecorps.org\">Fuse Corps</a> fellowships to work with partners to help drive local cross-sector collaborations around programs ranging from job creation to education to alternative energy projects.<strong>Bringing people together to create partnerships for a better future<br></strong>Led by their mantra, &#x201C;The revolution will be improvised&#x201D;, the social venture hopes to engage travelers on their route who want to join for a day or even team with them for the full tour. And for those who can&#x2019;t join in person, their website encourages people to share in the journey from wherever they are.The innovative minds leading the social venture include <a href=\"http://www.haroldoneal.com\">Harold O&#x2019;Neal, the pianist + innovator,</a> <a href=\"http://www.alexaclay.com\">Alexa Clay, the author + anthropologist</a>, <a href=\"http://petersims.com\">Peter Sims</a><a href=\"http://petersims.com\">, author + entrepreneur,</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/richard-tait/4/623/33\">Richard Tait</a> the entrepreneur and founder of <a href=\"http://www.hasbrogames.com/en-us/search?q=cranium\">Cranium</a>.

       "content_body":"Last year, HubSpot&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.culturecode.com\">Culture Code</a> went viral. The SlideShare, created by our CTO and co-founder Dharmesh Shah, inspired comments and compliments from partners, customers, industry experts and competitors alike. The deck itself is remarkable, but to me what&#x2019;s more important than the document is the degree to which we practice what we preach.A company&#x2019;s culture isn&#x2019;t about ping pong tables, free snacks and perks. It&#x2019;s about collective expectations for how you hire, fire, and work on a daily basis. People talk a lot about business plans as they relate to the P&amp;L, cash flow, and strategy to beat competitors, but invest very little time and energy into codifying how they actually run and manage the business on a daily basis.Businesses who ignore their company&#x2019;s culture do so at their own peril. In a <a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/03/how-companies-can-attract-the-best-college-talent/\">recent study</a> of 15,000 millennials, &#x201C;people and culture fit&#x201D; outpaced any other option as their top consideration for employment. You can give out all the t-shirts and swag you want, but the next generation of talent is cognizant of the fact that they&#x2019;ll spend years of their lives at work.HubSpot is different. Its founders are committed to building a company that matches how 21st century employees live and work. From the outset, they saw culture for what it could be: a significant competitive advantage in building a company that people want to work at for generations.Below are five ways your culture can be a competitive advantage, regardless of your industry, geography, or company history:<strong>1. Culture Defines What&#x2019;s Possible: </strong>In a recent <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/12/culture-eats-strategy-for-breakfast/\">TechCrunch article</a> on culture, MIT professor Bill Aulet quotes IBM&#x2019;s legendary leader Lou Gerstner as saying: &#x201C;In the end an organization is nothing more than the collective capacity of its people to create value.&#x201D; Steve Jobs was legendary for his reality distortion field, a series of expectations for his team that were described by most people (including employees) as delusional. Companies don&#x2019;t make the impossible possible by following the playbook of everyone else before them. They succeed because their organization is defined by a different set of beliefs, and they are able to deliver upon those promises. Organizations that inspire their employees with a defined culture of ingenuity and innovation expect more of their team and achieve more collectively &#x2013; and their products, marketing approach and customers benefit from that commitment.<strong>2. Culture is Powerful Weapon in the War for Talent: </strong>The very best employees in the world are often gainfully employed, not searching the web every day for job openings. As a result, companies need more than a boring job description to stand out from the pack in a highly competitive job market. Defining your culture sets a tone for the type of people you&#x2019;ll attract, and helps job seekers at the very top of your recruiting funnel get a sense for what makes your company tick. Chipotle uses <a href=\"http://www.chipotle.com/en-US/careers/real_stories/real_stories.aspx\">video</a> to highlight how their company empowers employees to grow, a tactic that allows them to be seen as less of a fast food job and more as a potential avenue for a longterm career. Our neighbors at <a href=\"http://www.wayfair.com/careers\">Wayfair</a> in Boston talk about hiring &#x201C;go-to people&#x201D; so that driven individuals know their company could be a great fit for them. An attractive company culture not only helps you recruit, it helps you recruit the right type of person for your working environment.<strong>3)</strong> <strong>A Strong Culture Empowers Employees to Make Good Decisions:&#xA0; </strong>One of the best known global leaders in company culture is Netflix. Their founder, Reed Hastings, codified the values they expect employees to exhibit in his wildly popular<a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664\"> slide deck</a>. But he also saw where traditional mission statements fall short: by outlining values without clarifying an expectation of how they should inform behavior. Next to each value in the Netflix deck is a series of examples of the type of behavior that personifies each trait. For example, &#x201C;impact&#x201D; is accompanied by, &#x201C;you focus on great results rather than process.&#x201D; Remarkable cultures don&#x2019;t just inform the C Suite &#x2013; they empower employees at all levels of the business to follow guideposts for decision making. Every single day, employees make thousands of decisions that can impact your business &#x2013; giving them a roadmap for how to think about those decisions through the filters of the company&#x2019;s culture saves time, energy, effort and money.<strong>4)</strong> <strong>Your Culture is a Promise To Your Customers: </strong>Twenty years ago, what people knew about your company was largely controlled by your marketing team. Potential customers had to rely upon written collateral and word of mouth to know what it was like to do business with your organization. Those days are long gone. The gap between the customer and your company is now 140 characters. Any prospect, at any time, can get real-time information about your products or services, and people buy based not only on your product, but on what your company stands for. The percentage of prospects researching HubSpot who visit our management pages for more information has increased the past several years because our customers want to know that we are committed to a great customer experience, care about transforming how business is conducted, and practice what we preach. In the post-Enron era, customers know that what companies believe informs how they operate, so culture helps inspire trust in potential buyers, which not only impacts your brand, but also your bottom line.<strong>5) Done Well, Culture Keeps You Honest: </strong>As you scale, grow, open new offices, and add more people, you can no longer rely on a small handful of people or a weekly tradition to keep your company disciplined around your culture. Like it or not, one person can no longer be responsible for interviewing everyone, for checking references, and for holding people accountable to a &#x201C;no assholes&#x201D; rule (we have one of those, so does Eventbrite&#x2014;<em>I&#x2019;m a huge fan</em>). Although culture has always been a huge part of our business at HubSpot, employees didn&#x2019;t want to talk much about it because it wasn&#x2019;t a discussion or a tactic; it was simply the way we <em>were</em>. That approach erodes over time, so investing the time and energy before you lose sight of what makes your company and your team special is imperative. At HubSpot, we view the Culture Code not as a constitution of sorts, but rather like our software, which we are constantly recalibrating to meet the needs of the customers we serve. Dharmesh frequently updates the Culture Code based on employee feedback, insights from trusted advisors and his own self-reflection, and the company&#x2019;s ongoing commitment to getting it right keeps us all honest about how well we are delivering on our approach to culture at regular intervals throughout the year.History is filled with companies who made excellence a habit with remarkable company cultures (IBM, GE, Netflix, and W.L Gore all come to mind), but it&#x2019;s also ripe with companies whose businesses fell due to a lack of accountability and ethics in their organizational practice (like Enron, WorldComm, and Arthur Andersen). Company cultures are not about plaques on the wall or posters in the office. They are about setting a clear vision and expectation for the type of people, work, attitude, and output expected from your team, and holding everyone accountable to that standard. Truly effective company cultures don&#x2019;t manifest themselves in one person, benefit, or tactic, but rather emulate the values and beliefs that make your company unique.Culture gets a bad rap in the corporate world for being &#x201C;soft&#x201D; in comparison to say, your balance sheet or P&amp;L. But the truth is that codifying, promoting, refactoring, and committing to a differentiated company culture is incredibly hard. However, when your company culture goes beyond jargon and marketing terminology and becomes the fabric of how your organization operates, it stands as a very real competitive advantage.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

The outdoor retailer attracts experienced outdoor lovers, mountain climbers and sportsman. But to disrupt their typical demographic and connect with women, they&#x2019;ve created an experience that invites them to be part of a 3-day adventure without needing to learn about outdoor activities ahead of time.The <a href=\"http://newsroom.rei.com/news/programs-adventures/rei-outessa-summit-launches-weekend-getaways-outdoor-adventure-for-women.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Outessa Summit</a> features outdoor education, recreation and adventure for women in a stunning mountain setting with activities ranging from sunrise yoga, to outdoor cooking classes, hiking, mountain biking and more. It offers adventures led by inspiring female guides and athletes and is curated to create unparalleled memories for those seeking adventure or simply a different kind of escape. REI provides camping concierges that help set up the campsite with essential gear and invites attendees to take the gear home with them post the event. They&#x2019;ve brilliantly created an experience that removes the barriers from trying new outdoor activities while connecting with a new audience.&#xA0;<strong>The Museum of Ice Cream </strong>The Museum of Ice Cream is a pop-up that creates a summer-inspired experience out of a much loved product. What started as a passion project, the pop-up was an experience that made a mark and other brands took note of. Within its 30 short days the museum generated buzz throughout the industry and was featured in <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/08/02/museum-of-ice-cream-new-york-photos/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune,</a> <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ice-cream-museum_us_57a09b48e4b0e2e15eb71973\" target=\"_blank\">Huffington Post</a>, and <a href=\"http://site.people.com/food/museum-of-ice-cream-nyc-photos/\" target=\"_blank\">People Magazine</a> among others.&#xA0;The experience goes beyond the standard museum by engaging with people through interactive stations and encouraging them to indulge in the treat in unique ways. The edible balloons made up of different sugars and blown up with helium are served on a stick and given to each attendee. There are ice cream sandwich swings, a sprinkle filled pool and a giant scoop of ice cream designed as a seesaw. There&#x2019;s even a Willy Wonka inspired tasting experience that changes sour taste receptors into sweet for 30 minutes. The pop-up museum was well thought out and succeeded in creating a meaningful experience that people will remember.&#xA0; &#xA0;<strong>PIRCH Designs A 360&#xB0; Sensory and Interactive Experience</strong><a href=\"https://www.pirch.com/home\" target=\"_blank\">PIRCH</a> proves it&#x2019;s not about the product, it&#x2019;s about providing a product experience. The brand is changing the retail landscape for the home appliance industry by providing a more in-depth brand experience for their customers, inviting them to interact with products before making a purchase. They&#x2019;ve created a setting that allows customers to play with fixtures and test how they might look together before buying them. They&#x2019;re invited to cook a meal, take a shower or test a sauna before making a decision. And on average, customers are spending two hours longer in PIRCH stores than their competitors&#x2019;. &#xA0;&#xA0;The inspiration behind the retail experience comes from the company&#x2019;s mission, <a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/why-should-joy-play-a-role-in-your-organization\" target=\"_blank\">bringing moments of joy to consumers&#x2019; lives</a>. PIRCH&#x2019;s breathtaking showrooms embody their merchandising philosophy, showcasing appliance collections, white glove installation, collaboration with the design community and a unique approach to creative curation. The company is committed to design and the quality of the guest experience.PIRCH is <a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/constant-disruption-is-and-always-has-been-the-new-norm\" target=\"_blank\">disrupting the retail landscape</a> as masters in experience and relationship design, combining education, service, elegance and value to deliver on their promise of joy. They are a must study for any retailer or brand looking to reinvent their model.<strong>Oreo Pop-Up Experience</strong>Oreo created the Oreo Wonder Vault off 18th Street in the heart of New York City in February of this year. Since then it has attracted thousands of Oreo fanatics and curious passersby. The pop-up was developed with the intent to create a unique brand experience around food prototyping.Oreo invited people to become a part of the brand in a unique way by actively engaging with the product rather than simply seeing it on shelves and in the media. <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/heres-whats-behind-mysterious-oreo-door-popped-nyc-today-169361\" target=\"_blank\">Adweek</a> referred to the design experience as something &#x201C;like a portal&#x201D; and the place where &#x201C;new Oreo flavors magically appear.&#x201D; When people open the giant Oreo door they receive a mystery box of Oreos, many times a flavor that isn&#x2019;t on retail shelves. And with as many as 50 prototype flavors and more than 100 additional ideas in the Oreo Wonder Vault there&#x2019;s likely to never to be a shortage of visitors wanting to experience the flavors.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Have you ever wondered if anybody knows who you are? I don&#x2019;t mean your name, what you do or where you&#x2019;re from. I mean the real you&#x2014;behind the clothes, the makeup, the smiles, and what kind of car you drive. The dynamic, constantly changing, ever-evolving, good, bad, and the ugly YOU. Do people know what fires you up, what irritates you, what inspires you to do good, or why you dress and talk the way you do?I remember a specific moment in college when I realized that despite being surrounded by hundreds of people and having dozens of good friends, no one knew the real me. The thought haunted me for weeks&#x2014;how could it be that I spend every waking minute with people, and yet they know very little about what makes me tick, what keeps me up at night, or what makes me cry?On the flip side, I&#x2019;ve always been a student of people. Since I was little I&#x2019;ve always listened to how people talk, watched how they act, and listened for the meaning behind their words.True confession: I eavesdrop on conversations. I have always been fascinated by how little people seem to notice how they come across to others&#x2014;missing conversational cues and opportunities for real connection. I cringe when I hear someone share good news with a friend, only to have their friend dismiss it with a nonchalant comment like, &#x201C;Oh, that&#x2019;s cool.&#x201D; I can&#x2019;t stand it when I hear someone vulnerably disclose a hard or painful story, hoping for validation and someone to share in their grief, only to have the other person respond with a lame platitude like, &#x201C;This too shall pass!&#x201D; Even worse still is the person who leaks their awkwardness all over the place, sharing too many or irrelevant details, missing all non-verbal signs that the story is going too far, and causing the other person to feel uncomfortable.How can it be that great friends are so rare and hard to find? How come no one teaches us how to be and act like a great friend? And why is it that so few people make the authentic effort to get to know the REAL ME?It&#x2019;s time to be the dumb one in the room, and adopt new relational skills in order to truly know and be known.<strong>Foster Insatiable Curiosity</strong><br> There&#x2019;s a difference between a good friend and a great friend. A good friend likes you and is happy to be with you. A great friend isn&#x2019;t satisfied by what they see and hear&#x2014;they want to know the deeper and unknown parts of you. My wife is a friend who embodies this curiosity more than anyone I&#x2019;ve ever met. She asks the most relevant and piercing questions, leaning in to listen while looking you in the eye&#x2014;and never talking until you&#x2019;ve finished what you have to say. She cuts to the chase and helps people understand their deeper selves. She&#x2019;s an amazing friend, and everyone is better for knowing her.Having a great friend is a rare and treasured gift, and impossible to manufacture. But <em>being</em> a great friend is a little bit easier because it&#x2019;s entirely in your control. And, as I&#x2019;ve found in my life, the best way to get great friends is to be one first.Here are three uncommon sense tips to being a great friend:<strong>Poke</strong> &#x2013; A good friend listens attentively to your stories. A great friend uses a different set of ears to uncover the story behind the story by asking provoking questions to reveal the deeper layers of feeling and impact. Use open-ended questions like, &#x201C;What do you think that says about you?&#x201D; or &#x201C;How did that make you feel?&#x201D; to poke around.<strong>Rejoice</strong> &#x2013; A great friend listens and notices when something deserves celebration, even if you can&#x2019;t relate or don&#x2019;t understand why it&#x2019;s a good thing. When a friend shares happy news, party with them like it&#x2019;s your own, even if they don&#x2019;t emote a big reaction&#x2014;they might be a bit timid to share. Go wild with high fives, hugs and genuine shouts of joy.<strong>Mourn</strong> &#x2013; A great friend sees hurt behind the defenses and understands that everyone needs permission to grieve a loss. Mirror their emotional facial expressions.&#xA0;Offer validating comments like, &#x201C;No wonder you&#x2019;re so upset,&#x201D; or &#x201C;I&#x2019;d feel awful, too, if I were you!&#x201D; Extend you support by saying things like, &#x201C;Even though you were let go from your job, I want you to know that I think you&#x2019;re incredibly smart and talented.&#x201D;A great friend, fueled by curiosity and the desire to truly embrace and accept who the other person is on the inside (for better <span>and</span> worse), is the greatest gift in life. Don&#x2019;t wait for other people to be a great friend to you before you start acting that way. The fact is, most people were never taught what a great friend is and does. Go first, and let people know what kind of friend you&#x2019;re looking for in return.Poking, rejoicing and mourning are the keys to unlocking potential in relationships. And it&#x2019;s not just advice for personal friendships&#x2014;these tips are relevant in sales, management, team collaboration, parenting, dating, or any other area of life. These principles will transform a relationship, unleash a team, and make life meaningful<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

It&#x2019;s easy to appreciate the good stuff, the stuff our culture views as positive, but it&#x2019;s much harder to appreciate the painful and challenging things life throws our way.&#xA0;We&#x2019;ve featured a series of commencement speeches that do an especially good job of providing uncommon sense wisdom to help us appreciate the difficult parts of life. <a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/appreciate-every-traffic-jam\" target=\"_blank\">David Foster Wallace reminded us</a> that in moments of boredom or frustration, we have the power to choose how to see our situation. <a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/stop-pretending-its-possible-to-avoid-contradiction\" target=\"_blank\">Joss Whedon encouraged us</a> to embrace the contradictions in ourselves and others, and to sit with&#xA0;the tension. Our third feature comes from <a href=\"http://www.jkrowling.com/\" target=\"_blank\">JK Rowling</a> and speaks to&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHGqp8lz36c\" target=\"_blank\">The Fringe Benefits of Failure</a>.&#xA0;<strong>Failure: the other F word.</strong>From the time we are children, we&#x2019;re sent the message that failure is shameful and that we must avoid it at all costs. As we get older, we develop&#xA0;or internalize a personal vision&#xA0;of success. Rowling reminds us that&#xA0;the world is eager to determine what constitutes both success and failure for us if we let it. But&#xA0;no matter what definitions we choose to&#xA0;hold, we will all inevitably fail at some points in our lives.<strong>&#x201C;</strong><strong>It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all &#x2013; in which case, you fail by default.&#x201D;</strong>&#xA0;Rowling is an incredibly successful woman who has also known profound failure. What is so beautiful about the way she discusses both is that she romanticizes neither. Though she focuses on the benefits of failing, she also emphasizes that there is no way to avoid the pain that accompanies it. Appreciating every step does not mean pretending that we can avoid pain.<strong>We learn more valuable lessons in failure than we do in success.</strong>Failure hurts. But if we want to rise back up, we have to learn and grow from it. Failure forces us to change because there is no alternative. Though it feels good when things are going well, we don&#x2019;t grow as much because there is nothing pushing us. Rowling says, &#x201C;Had I really succeeded at anything else, I might never have found the determination to succeed in the one arena I believed I truly belonged. I was set free, because my greatest fear had been realized, and I was still alive, and I still had a daughter whom I adored, and I had an old typewriter and a big idea. And so rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life.&#x201D;<strong>Success offers a fragile sense of stability. Failure offers enduring confidence.</strong>It sounds odd to suggest that failure, rather than success, brings us confidence. But if we have never had to rise from a fall, how can we know that we have the strength to get back up? Without failing, our sense of stability remains dependent on constant success. Rowling reminds us that, &#x201C;the knowledge that you have emerged wiser and stronger from setbacks means that you are, ever after, secure in your ability to survive. You will never truly know yourself, or the strength of your relationships, until both have been tested by adversity. Such knowledge is a true gift, for all that it is painfully won, and it has been worth more than any qualification I ever earned.&#x201D;Confidence is painfully won. In the midst of profound failure, it&#x2019;s difficult to appreciate the situation because no matter how many times we fail, it will continue to hurt. But if we rest in the knowledge that we will emerge stronger, wiser, and more confident in ourselves and our relationships, we can make it through with a sense of hope rather than shame. And eventually, we may&#xA0;be able to look back on our lives&#xA0;with gratitude for the times we &quot;failed.&quot;<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wHGqp8lz36c\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Online education has increased its presence from nonentity in the 1980s to a visible part of everyday life. Now everything from supplemental online certifications to&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.onlinegraduateprograms.com/\" target=\"_blank\">online graduate degrees</a> are available. For-profit programs, such as University of Phoenix, DeVry University, Everest University, and Kaplan University advertise heavily to recruit students to their programs, and conventional universities are increasingly relying on Internet-based tools to offer courses that are either entirely or partially online. However, as <a href=\"http://www.ies.ncsu.edu/successes/research-and-white-papers/pros-and-cons-of-online-education/\" target=\"_blank\">education moves further</a> in this direction, many look at the transformation taking place and wonder whether or not this is a good thing.One of the obvious <a href=\"http://www.elearners.com/online-education-resources/online-learning/added-value-in-e-learning-3-valuable-benefits-of-online/\" target=\"_blank\">advantages of an online university education</a> is the matter of scalability. A university designed to host 30,000 students can never enroll more than that without investing in an expansion. An online university, however, faces relatively little additional structural cost when its numbers grow. This scalability makes online education very attractive to those who want to lower education costs and make education available to everyone. However, by making education more readily available, online methodologies create new problems. Like most of its competitors, University of Phoenix, the world&#x2019;s largest online university (and one of the world&#x2019;s largest universities in terms of enrollment) sets a very low qualification bar for enrollment. To enroll, students only need a high school diploma or GED, which makes many question the real value of an online degree.Another related problem results from the fact that many online universities are <a href=\"http://ope.ed.gov/accreditation/\" target=\"_blank\">not properly accredited</a>. They can offer courses, issue grades and diplomas, but when they do not abide by the standards commonly accepted by governments, businesses, and other educational institutions, their degrees mean very little.This perceived lack of value has led to a mixed and hesitant receptiveness to online programs among established universities. While program developers acknowledge the benefits of online education, they also fear that diving head-first into the online movement will lower the reputation of their programs. Despite this hesitance, however, conventional universities for the most part are moving forward with the adoption of online tools. For example, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with its <a href=\"http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\">CourseWare</a> and subsequent MITx ventures, is making the content of its courses available to the entire world for free. Initially, the viewing of these online course materials did not result in a credential for students. However, for the sake of propagating knowledge and protecting the value of its conventional programs, MIT is making plans to offer separate credentials based on its free online courses.Many established universities have become willing to offer associate&#x2019;s degrees and bachelor&#x2019;s degrees for completion of online courses but refuse to issue <a href=\"http://www.sicet.org/journals/ijttl/issue0601/AberasturiKongrith%20Vol2%20Iss1_50_57.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">advanced degrees </a>without old fashioned, brick-and-mortar classrooms. This is due to a perception that lower-level degrees tend to require more &#x201C;book learning&#x201D;&#x2014;which is conducive to online education platforms&#x2014;while upper-level degrees tend to require more &#x201C;hands-on learning.&#x201D; Projects, discussion, and research become the focus of graduate-level coursework, which cannot be properly conducted online.Proponents of online education feel that conventional universities offer this boundary in the attempt to stay relevant and control quality. However, as long as employers feel that MBAs and PhDs from conventional universities have more value than their online counterparts, these programs will still face an uphill battle towards gaining a foothold on being a part of the academic status quo. Thus, online educational opportunities may not reach advanced-level programs, but they do enable higher education to reach more people than ever before. Even if online degrees are not given the same recognition, they have increased the accessibility of education. By having this access to education, America will foster the growth of a more educated populace.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"It&#x2019;s no secret that we love a healthy dose of uncommon sense. Our friend Roy Goble&#x2019;s new book, <a href=\"http://www.junkyardwisdom.com/junkyard-wisdom-book/\">Junkyard Wisdom</a>, advocates an uncommon sense approach to wealth and philanthropy. Roy&#x2019;s book is written from a Christian perspective, but his message can be applied to everyone, regardless of our religious background or beliefs.<strong>It&#x2019;s not about the money<br></strong>Roy&#x2019;s perspective is refreshing and realistic; he has managed to find the middle ground between two extreme and opposing views regarding money. One advocates for idolizing money and viewing it as an end in itself rather than a means to bigger dreams. This perspective says that success is determined by your bank statement alone. The other extreme demonizes money saying that it&#x2019;s the root of all evil, something to be ashamed of and avoided at all costs.Roy says neither of these poles is healthy. Taking a much more neutral and uncommon position, he says that money, like a person, has the potential for both good and evil.&#xA0;&#x201C;<em>Money is a tool. It is also a temptation. It&#x2019;s many things, in fact, but evil isn&#x2019;t one of them&#x2026; Does the potential for evil hide within money? Yes&#x2014;but so does the potential for great good. That same potential for goodness hides inside many human creations, like art and education. The fact that art can become propaganda, or that education can become indoctrination, doesn&#x2019;t deter most [people] from valuing art and education</em>.&#x201D;<strong>Wrestling with wealth<br></strong>As a wealthy real estate investor in Silicon Valley and a co-founder of a Christian non-profit, Roy is frequently in the presence of people from both views. He often finds himself caught in the middle and embraces the position because he believes that he is supposed to wrestle with his wealth. This is much more challenging place than either using it all for self-indulgent pleasures or giving it all away to charity. Wrestling with wealth requires the need for continuous informed decisions about where his money will have the most effective impact.<strong>Use the tools you have been given<br></strong>Roy sees his wealth as a tool to be used to affect change around the world. To young adults who want to drop out of college or leave their high paying jobs to do full time charity work, he challenges them to consider that they may already be in a much better position to create big change.There is no one right way to do good in the world. If we find ourselves in a position of privilege, our responsibility is not to refuse the opportunities we have been given in pursuit of seemingly more noble work. Instead, we should use our individual talents to create unique contributions, because the reality is that money is almost always a big piece of helping people or creating change. So if you have money to spare, you have the ability to fulfill a need somewhere.<strong>The amnesia of wealth<br></strong>Roy also reminds his readers that &#x201C;wealth is a master illusionist.&#x201D; It allows us to put up walls, to go on a volunteer trip or mission, learn something or fund something, and then move on. This is the amnesia of wealth. It allows us to escape and put on blinders. To remain conscious of the pain that exists beyond the comfort of our bubbles requires a concerted effort.&#xA0;<strong>Treat others the way <em>they</em> want to be treated<br></strong>Roy further reminds readers that no matter whom or where we are trying to offer help, we have to work to see people as individuals within the context of their lives, and we have to ask them how we can best help with their unique situations. We cannot ever assume that we know the best way to help someone because everyone is the expert on their own life, but never the lives of others. So ask the experts what <em>they </em>need?<strong>Pay attention to complacency, not money<br></strong>Ultimately, talking too much about money as either positive or negative is not constructive. What really matters is the person and the attitude behind the capital. Complacency, not wealth, is the real danger. <em>&#x201C;Complacency is a terrible model for human life. Complacent companies stagnate or fail. Complacent animals lose territory. Complacent students learn a few things by rote, only to soon forget them.&#x201D; </em>So no matter who you are or what your financial status is, remember that critical thinking and conscious actions are the key to creating change.We want to share Roy&#x2019;s three uncommon sense tips to &#x201C;<em>help stay healthy and balanced in the ongoing wrestling match of life</em>.&#x201D; These tips apply not only to philanthropy, but business and relationships alike.For more junkyard wisdom, check out the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Junkyard-Wisdom-Resisting-Whisper-Wealth/dp/1940269970\">here</a>.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "principle":"AN EXPERIENCE IS MORE THAN THE PICTURE",
       "content_body":"Earlier in my career, I was making a transition from VP marketing to Chief Financial Officer of a global public company. Even though I had prior financial experience, it was still an unusual step. Thankfully, I had the good fortune to tap the expertise of a mentor. Bob Hunt had years of experience as a successful public company CFO and a deep understanding of the challenges. He believed that there are three stages in a career: learn, earn, and return. Learn your craft, earn a living, and then return it by sharing your experience with others. I&#x2019;m grateful that Bob was in return mode for me.Along with learning from Bob&#x2019;s experience, I also took heed of his example. So these days, I devote time to mentoring business leaders, emerging entrepreneurs, and college students. The people I work with represent a wide range in ages, stages, and interests. While I do my best to understand their needs and help them achieve their goals, I have to admit that I&#x2019;m learning from them too.In my work as founder of <a href=\"http://www.bottlerocketadvisors.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bottle Rocket Advisors</a>, co-founder of a sport products company, and as a global strategy officer, VP marketing, public company CFO, and on boards of directors, I&#x2019;ve also met some incredibly effective entrepreneurs and leaders. Through all of those, I&#x2019;ve seen that there are several mindset characteristics shared by the best of them.I believe that you can&#x2019;t gift someone a future but you can help them prepare for it. In that spirit, I wanted to pass along a few of those characteristics. In this season of graduations and transitions to new opportunities, I believe these tips are useful in whatever pursuit one takes.<strong>Be willing&#x2026;</strong>What stands out most among successful folks isn&#x2019;t their pride. Sure, they&#x2019;ve got a lot of wins to talk about but the most notable characteristic is their humility. Charlie Postins, co-founder of The Honest Kitchen, a $40+ million pet food company, said &#x201C;We were very humble about what we did and didn&#x2019;t know. And we weren&#x2019;t going to pretend we knew.&#x201D; That sort of willingness orientation is healthy because it opens up opportunities to look, to listen, to learn, and to collaborate with others to achieve mutual goals.<strong>Be wondering&#x2026;</strong>Lots of ink has been devoted to dreaming. There&#x2019;s nothing bad about dreaming but it&#x2019;s not quite the right approach, in my opinion. I&#x2019;ve found that effective people are less about dreaming and more about wondering. The difference is in action. Dreaming is a head-in-the-clouds, what-I-want sort of thought process. Wondering is a more pragmatic, observation and problem-solving mindset. Maybe that&#x2019;s why Socrates said, &#x201C;Wisdom begins in wonder.&#x201D; The people who tend to follow through on their ideas are those who are wondering what could be, what could be better, what should be, and what they need to do to make it all happen.<strong>Be welcoming&#x2026;</strong>Along with humility, another characteristic that stands out for effective people is that they tend to be open. As people looking to bring about change, they usually are welcoming of change themselves. They welcome questions, people, ideas, challenges, responsibilities, and expectations. They also welcome the clarity that comes from the scoreboard. This welcome approach doesn&#x2019;t leave them scattered but instead open to learning and adapting&#x2026;or to staying the course after considering what they&#x2019;ve heard. They tend not to be set in their position or opinion but rather secure in their ability to critically consider new thoughts.<strong>Be working&#x2026;</strong>There&#x2019;s no secret to hard work but it is a secret. Less effective people tend not to want something badly enough to focus on it long enough and hard enough to get it. I love that quote &#x201C;If you want something bad enough, you&#x2019;ll find a way. If you don&#x2019;t, you&#x2019;ll find an excuse.&#x201D; Here&#x2019;s the other thing. The most effective folks work hard, they work consistently, they work selflessly, and they work well with others. No surprise. What is unique is that many of them take their work not as part of a task or a job but rather they view it all as part of a cause. As a result, they&#x2019;re very committed and also tend to be more satisfied with the sacrifices necessary in the journey to achieve their goals.<strong>Be wandering&#x2026;</strong>Yes, wandering conjures up an image of someone lacking purpose or direction. Certain people personify the curiosity that fuels an interest in exploring but also retain the focus to be searching for something specific or the awareness to connect what they find to an end. I call that aimful wandering. They do it to observe problems, generate ideas, to get what they need, to find answers, and to see how they can help. And that extends to seeking advocates and mentors with experiences and voices to help them.<strong>Be an owner...</strong>If there is one trait that achievers have an abundance of, it&#x2019;s ownership. They tend to have an overdeveloped sense that they&#x2019;re personally responsible for their choices, their actions, their time, and themselves. Regardless of their official role, they take ownership. And that includes extending gratitude, sharing recognition, and instilling the same pride of ownership in their teams. This is ownership without arrogance. Taking ownership is perhaps one of the most important characteristics toward building a meaningful career.As we all know, life doesn&#x2019;t come with a blueprint. These qualities can help lend a framework for the challenges everyone faces as they wrestle with the steady stream of ambiguity. Nonetheless, moving forward is about making conscious choices &#x2013; and then acting on them. Choices not made &#x2013; like chances not taken &#x2013; too often end in regret. Here&#x2019;s to applying the vital &#x201C;Be&#x201D; skills that make up your own &#x201C;A&#x201D; game.<em>Read more from <a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/author/michael-irwin#filters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Michael</a>.</em><em>Original <a href=\"http://www.bottlerocketadvisors.com/bottle-rocket-blog/2018/5/21/you-cant-gift-someone-a-future-but-you-can-help-them-prepare-for-it\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a>.&#xA0;</em><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"<span class=\"s1\">According to the dictionary definition &#x201C;leadership is the action of leading a group of people or an organization&#x201D;.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&#xA0; </span>Perhaps we should look at leadership from a different perspective. Leadership is the cooperative action that is demonstrated through the talents and skills of people either in a family, community or by employees at all levels of a corporate organization. </span><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Without the collective performance of an orchestra a conductor has no music and an audience is cheated out of a symphony.<br><br></strong></span><span class=\"s1\">When people think of a leader, generally pictures of a single person appear. Some are feared while others are admired. Shifting perspective to view leadership from the group or the team&#x2014;in which each person, member of a company works to achieve an overall goal through individual contributions using their talents, skills to innovate or serve others&#x2014;creates incredible results every day. Both the leader and the team share more expanded view of what <em>leadership </em>is and is more likely to consider the contributions of all members of the enterprise. </span><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Ants can teach us a valuable lesson in team work &#x2014; they work together, each ant having specific tasks.<br><br></strong>While charismatic leaders can make a difference, it is generally their teams that are vital to the success or recognition of their companies. Venture capital start-ups investors generally place great value on the quality of a team that demonstrates alignment of the founding members on the direction of the company and their team&#x2019;s role in achieving their vision. An open environment of trust and communication in which team members are enthusiastic about using their skills to innovate and, to achieve something worthwhile, will always excel against the odds.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&#xA0; </span><em>&#x201C;Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence win championships.&#x201D; -Michael Jordan. </em></span><span class=\"s1\">If you&#x2019;re a Star Trek fan you probably remember the collective of the Borg - a fictional entity in which each individual (Borg) perform specific task toward a common objective - however, unlike the Borgs we are not reactionary drones and make decisions on courses of action using innate talents and learned skills that makes us quite distinct and, when shared as part of a family, community or workplace are invaluable.&#xA0;</span><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Building a corporate culture of leaders is like coaching an all-star basketball team.</strong></span><span class=\"s1\">Forming leadership teams when individual roles are not optimal is not for the faint of heart. This doesn&#x2019;t happen automatically especially in our Western culture where autonomy is frequently celebrated. Without clear and specific focus from management or executives of a company; teamwork may not be fruitful. To be successful everyone must be in agreement and willing to operate within the boundaries of a team. There is no room for single stars or anyone seeking individual recognition. Team members must be fully committed to the end-goals and, be ready to work through conflicts and disagreements, in order to effectively create solutions in a very competitive world. Each situation should be looked at individually, to determine whether an undertaking will benefit from a team approach. If that is the case, start by creating a small team with a distinct qualitative goal that each member on the team understands and commits to. </span><span class=\"s1\">In June 1992, the US men&#x2019;s Olympic basketball team brought together some of the greatest players in the history of basketball. Among them Charles Barkley, Larry Bird, Patrick Ewing, Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, Karl Malone, and Scottie Pippen.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&#xA0; </span>During a scrimmage against college players the &#x201C;Dream Team&#x201D; lost by eight points as reported by the<a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/1992-06-25/sports/sp-1411_1_olympic-team\"><span class=\"s2\"> LA Times</span></a>. Scottie Pippen said it best following the game <em>&#x201C;We didn&#x2019;t know how to play with each other,&#x201D;</em> the dream team went on to win later and won the 1992 Olympic gold after making sure that each player was using his skills to play together and toward one cohesive objective. The rest is history, they scored over 100 points in every game at the Olympics.</span><span class=\"s1\"><strong>No one is born a leader. <br><br></strong></span><span class=\"s1\">The skills must be learned and exercised. Executives must create and maintain a culture that encourage all levels of an organization to excel and to discover their talents in order to contribute to the enterprise. This requires personal investments and organizational commitment that help people to grow in leadership through mentoring, training and recognition. Having continuous processes in place that promote the abilities and qualities of all people are important because they help an organization meet its goals at any levels.&#xA0;</span><span class=\"s1\">Such an approach makes for a new definition of leadership that takes into consideration the valuable contributions of each person, for indeed an organization is the sum of all its associates:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&#xA0; </span><em>&#x201C;A leader. . .is like a shepherd. He stays behind the flock, letting the most nimble go out ahead, whereupon the others follow, not realizing that all along they are being directed from behind.&#x201D;</em><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&#xA0; </span>&#x2013;<em>Nelson Mandela, former President of South Africa</em></span>&#xA0;<span class=\"s1\"><em>Read more from <a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/author/jos-pierre#filters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jose</a>.</em></span><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"<em>a.k.a. the 1% Investor Challenge</em>I hear from CEO&#x2019;s and Investors that one of their strategic guidelines is to &#x201C;invest in the team&#x201D; and that talent and culture are strategic differentiators. I think they mean they try to find &#x201C;ready-made&#x201D; leaders and executive teams and give them money to succeed in their plans. In the past 25 years, I&#x2019;ve worked with thousands of leaders from middle managers to senior executives, to entrepreneurs, founders and board members. Not one of them was a&#xA0;<em>born</em>&#xA0;leader.Successful leaders have many stories about how their experience has shaped their approach to business, people, and customers. Many are &#x201C;self-made&#x201D; leaders, having learned quickly from their mistakes, adapted to unforeseen circumstances, or demonstrated relentless curiosity. But all great leaders are made over time, with dedicated focus and effort toward personal and professional effectiveness. There is sufficient evidence in someone&#x2019;s life to inspect and evaluate if he or she is effective in key aspects of &#x201C;scalable&#x201D; leadership, but this is too often left unexamined by investors.Having worked side-by-side, in the trenches at dozens of start-ups, I can tell you the demands on company executives are tremendous. They face high speed, complex, ambiguous, uncertain conditions all day, every day. It strikes me as odd that investors don&#x2019;t actually &#x201C;invest&#x201D; in the leaders of their companies. They hand over millions of dollars to the Founder/CEO to build a company, but they rarely spend any of it on the leaders themselves. I think this is an incredible oversight in due diligence, and a gapping hole in fiduciary responsibility. Hope is not a strategy.It seems unreasonable to assume a CEO (even a serial entrepreneur) will be successful leading a fast-growing, 100+ person organization with no attention to his or her personal effectiveness. Their very nature makes it more likely they will end up like Travis Kalanick than Bob Iger. Leading a complex organization (anything over 75 people) requires a well-honed set of interpersonal skills, professional presence and strategic talent planning (see Facebook and Google) to be successful.Recently I&#x2019;ve approached dozens of venture capitalists and private equity investors with the proposal to invest in their executives through proven leadership tools and programs. Nearly all of them have responded with some form of &#x201C;that&#x2019;s nice to consider some day, but we don&#x2019;t have enough money right now.&#x201D; Huh? What they&#x2019;re really saying is, we don&#x2019;t care about the actual people in the company. We make a bunch of investments and hope like hell at least 1 pays back enough to carry the fund. This is called spreading the risk. All that people stuff is too messy and soft to address.I think it&#x2019;s time for investors to start owning the outcome of their lack of attention to leadership and talent. If you want to make a difference in the world by building companies, you should conduct due diligence on your executives, not just the company finances. If you think talent and culture are strategic differentiators, ensure that proper efforts are being made to develop the CEO and the executive team. Otherwise you&#x2019;re just throwing money away and hoping for a technically savvy founder will somehow figure out how to transfer zero experience working in groups to high impact organizational leadership.The average Series A deal size in 2016 was $5M. Series B average was $12M, and later stage deals average over $25M. I&#x2019;ve heard more than one CEO say they put their money on advertising and engineers, not HR. That might get you traction, but it won&#x2019;t get you sustainable high performance. If you are in the game for a quick flip, I get it. But if you are really trying to build a high performing company, leadership is not &#x201C;nice to do,&#x201D; it&#x2019;s an essential catalyst that unlocks sustainable growth.<strong>So, here&#x2019;s my challenge to any investor willing to test it:</strong>Earmark 1% of your next investment for executive development. If you&#x2019;re putting in $1M make sure $10K is spent on development for the CEO and the leadership team. If you lay down $10M, certainly a $100K investment in the top team will improve your chances of success. Even better, consider investing 1% of your total fund in the proper resources to support leadership development in the full portfolio. You can achieve much better economies of scale and cross pollination in that approach. You can even develop a unique portfolio advantage by doing this better than other investors. It&#x2019;s a true value add for your money. And it will pay you back with better performing companies.I understand that not all development is worth it, and that some efforts are a complete waste of time. Run it like any other A/B test you use in marketing. Identify the intervention and track the progress. If you have any questions about what kind of leadership development works best, impact feel free to contact me or check in with an executive development specialist you already know.If just one more of the companies in your portfolio steers clear of the failures of executive leadership your fund will be twice as good. That&#x2019;s smart money.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

In order to succeed, we need to align our bodies and minds to better adapt to our day-to-day activities, leveraging both old (meditation, yoga, etc.) and new (videos, devices, etc.) offerings, which will also help to unlock the untapped potential within.<br><br><strong>The Driving Force</strong><br>The words &#x201C;passion&#x201D; and &#x201C;motivation&#x201D; are often overused when describing the driving force and only describe one part of the downstream process. We often forget that there are also conscious and unconscious forces that enable us to act with a sense of purpose in our upstream process.<br><br>These driving forces encompass an emotional kaleidoscope that range from meek (pouring a cup of coffee) to very powerful (writing a piece like Mahler&#x2019;s Symphony #2). They are the sparks that kick off our emotions, empowering us to reach new heights and push the envelope&#x2014;not just inspiring the will to live, but a love of life. These powerful forces from within enable us to do the things we do and being able to control them allow us to create a harmonious internal balance and be better prepared to reach our goals and objectives.<br><br><strong>Square One</strong><br>We must first sync our minds and bodies to better deal with reaching our defined goals and objectives&#x2014;and there is no shortage of ways to do it. From reading a paperback copy of Ovid&#x2019;s Metamorphoses for inspirational purposes to throwing a Fitbit on to track your activity and sleeping patterns, choices are infinite. While someone may prefer attending a yoga retreat in a remote part of the Adirondacks, another may find balance from walking along the beach in Copacabana on a quiet morning. Of course, excuses are always plentiful but it is up to the individual to take action and become better prepared for the tasks at hand. At an organic level, the better aligned we are as an organism, the better our ability to dig deep within ourselves to spark downstream feelings like passion and motivation.<br><br><strong>Unlocking Our Potential</strong><br>Potential is often sparked through a variety of measures&#x2014;some being visual, some from previous experiences and synthesized knowledge, and others from motivation and inspiration&#x2014;and these triggers set off a whole new set of possibilities. From a visualized point-of-view, this process of unlocking hidden potential looks a lot more like unlocking a combination lock within in a bank vault than using a simple lock and key. The triggers (articles, videos, artwork, etc.) help to stimulate our thought process much like the tumblers housed within the bank vault. Sometimes previous experiences that guide our learning, like a visit to the Smithsonian, and other times we learn by doing, like touching a hot plate.<br><br>Unlocking potential is also provoked through synthesizing information. One may hear the latest gossip on Sand Hill Road about what companies are in vogue, which could prompt swift action in the form of an investment.<br><br>It&#x2019;s up to each of us to find what makes us tick.<br><br><strong>A Sense of Purpose</strong><br>The real question is, &#x201C;why are we doing this?&#x201D; Let us look at two possible scenarios. First is our own self-interest. We could be crafting an online presentation to a high-level group and want it to be perfect. In this scenario, a great deal of research has to be done regarding what the intended audience is looking for as well as ensuring the accuracy of the content. It must also be crafted in such a way that the people viewing the presentation can both comprehend and absorb the content being shown. The theme is twofold: attention to detail and a creative spin&#x2014;and this is precisely where upstream meets downstream. The subconscious may spur the creative process, while the conscious tackles the more technical issues. In any event, a person has to draw upon the aforementioned facts and, in the process, unlock hidden potential brought about by this task.<br><br>Second is others&#x2019; interest. This &#x201C;motivation&#x201D; or &#x201C;inspiration&#x201D; could be in the form of directing, coaching or teaching&#x2014;for example, getting a child fired-up to take an exam like the ACT or SAT. This is a situation in which a person&#x2019;s inner force, or drive, is meant to result in action that will influence others. It is a way of &#x201C;transferring&#x201D; these motivational or inscriptional feelings to others so they can better deal with, or excel, in their tasks. In this case, extensive research must be done regarding the topic in order to provide the other person with useful advice, so they may be better prepared. This is not a trivial undertaking, as one can mean well but still give poor advice. Accordingly, the person giving the advice must be well versed in the defined topic, while being very careful on tactics regarding advice, motivation or inspiration, and properly manage expectations.<br><br>There is no question that the force that drives us is derived from both our conscious and subconscious, which directly influences our behavior. We must also be cognizant on how we advise, motivate or inspire, and properly manage expectation of others. That is why we must try from the outset to align our bodies and minds in a balanced and harmonious manner that will not only benefit our own actions, but also the people we influence.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"It&#x2019;s that time of the year and it feels like it has arrived even quicker than in the past. As you wind down to celebrate the holidays, and the year that has just passed, it&#x2019;s good to&#xA0;reflect and be thankful for the good, the bad, and the ugly. I find it helpful to take the time to be grateful for the wins and losses throughout the past year and to make sure I understand what worked, what didn&#x2019;t, and what I&#x2019;m going to change in the year ahead. This is a great formula to ensure I appreciate life and all that it delivers.One highlight from this past year was working with an amazing wine maker on the central coast of California to build a new brand of wine that will launch in 2014. It has often struck me how balanced his life looks, yet most of his success is dependent on many elements beyond his control. Like life, some years&#xA0;are naturally better than others and some are even off-the-charts fantastic. While I don&#x2019;t believe we&#x2019;re in full control of all the conditions that affect our lives, we can&#x2014;much like a wine maker&#x2014;plant the right seeds, cultivate the right growing conditions, and water each day with inputs that give us the best chance of making our lives the best they can be.As you look forward to 2014, think of it as a year that has the potential to be a vintage year, one that&#x2019;s going to be your best, that you&#x2019;ll look back on fondly. Think about what you want the year to look like, plot goals for each month and decide what you want to accomplish by season or by quarter. Think about what you need to put into the year and what you need to stop doing and start doing. Write a manifesto, put up&#xA0;a year-board with milestones&#xA0;and march into the year prepared with the mindset that it&#x2019;s going to be one of your best.Unlike the winemaker and his dance with nature, we do control some of the most important conditions that affect our success. We control how we participate in life every day. We can be ready to take on each day with a can-do grateful attitude, aware of who and what&#x2019;s happening around us. The old adage &#x201C;you reap what you sow&#x201D; is true, so I think the following uncommon sense prompters for making the best out of life will help you grow in the new year and make it one to remember.<strong>1. Find your purpose&#xA0;</strong><br> Do you know what your purpose is?&#xA0;If you can&#x2019;t answer that question, this is the year to figure it out. Explore and define your purpose so it can fuel why you get out of bed every day. Once you can answer this question with conviction, you&#x2019;ll do everything else with a level of clarity, enjoyment and commitment.<strong>2. Craft a cunning plan</strong><br> Living life without a plan is like sailing the Pacific without a map&#x2014;you could end up in North Korea. Map out what you&#x2019;d like the seasons or quarters of 2014 to look like and what it will take to get there. As George S. Patton said, &#x201C;A good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan executed next week.&#x201D;<strong>3. Talk about ideas and not people</strong><br> Like Eleanor Roosevelt said, &#x201C;Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people.&#x201D; Aim for being great and talk more about big, transformational ideas in 2014.&#xA0;Make a list of the things that you waste time&#xA0;on every day and decide what you&#x2019;re going to do to change your behavior.<strong>4.&#xA0;Start your day early and start it right</strong><br> When I&#x2019;m not traveling, I&#x2019;m in the ocean at 6am surfing. It&#x2019;s an amazing way to start the day disconnected from technology with time to think and&#xA0;enjoy the beauty of nature.&#xA0;Design how you&#x2019;ll start your day before the madness begins, and make the time to do something that inspires and energizes you for the day ahead.<strong>5. Savor every day like it&#x2019;s your last&#xA0;</strong><br> Live in the now,&#xA0;because life is not a dress rehearsal.&#xA0;You can&#x2019;t rewrite yesterday but you can live today like it&#x2019;s the best day ever.&#xA0;Don&#x2019;t cry over spilled milk and don&#x2019;t wish things had been different. Learn from your challenges and mistakes rather than dwelling on them.<strong>6. Smell the roses and the coffee</strong><br> Our days are moving at warp speed,&#xA0;time is standing still for no one,&#xA0;and we&#x2019;re more dependent on our connected technology devices than ever.&#xA0;Don&#x2019;t let the beauty of a sunset, the smell of fresh ground coffee or the power of the wind pass you by without inhaling the moment. It&#x2019;s the small encounters that make a brighter day.<strong>7. Talk less and listen more</strong><br> Let&#x2019;s face it &#x2013; most of us talk too much. Take the time to listen to others more intently this year. Honestly acknowledge others, whether the conversation is good, bad or indifferent. Try to cut down on your verbal output; it&#x2019;s amazing what you learn when you listen to others.<strong>8. Join the can-do club</strong><br> Can-do people inspire others and find ways to do the impossible.&#xA0;Negative people create reasons why something amazing can&#x2019;t be done. Look around at who&#x2019;s in your circle and decide what type of energy you want to create this year. Be genuinely excited for others, acknowledge their contributions, talents and successes, and remember it&#x2019;s&#xA0;not a problem until it&#x2019;s really a problem.<strong>9. Embrace change</strong><br> Change is one of the only constants in this life,&#xA0;so don&#x2019;t fight it; embrace it for all that it can teach you. If you&#x2019;re in a rut, bored and find yourself living a mundane routine, change your pace and create a life you&#x2019;re proud to live.<strong>10. Downtime is good time</strong><br> Switch off and unplug the smartphone at least one day on the weekend so you can relax with a little down time and do absolutely nothing.&#xA0;Plan some regular alone time to think about your life and the big picture.<strong>11. If at first you don&#x2019;t succeed, try like a barbarian</strong><br> It&#x2019;s far easier to give up when you hit the wall or land on your butt. Failure is an opportunity to learn, grow and improve. Keep trying until you get it right.<strong>12.&#xA0;You reap what you sow&#xA0;</strong><br> What you get out of 2014 is completely up to you. What you put in will impact what you get out of it.&#xA0;Ask yourself what type of person you want to be this coming year&#x2013;attitude is everything. It&#x2019;s up to you to make 2014 a vintage year for the books.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"As founders of a startup, our challenge is to build a fuel-efficient engine from the onset to efficiently gain the most power and the furthest distance. To meet the challenge we&#x2019;ve transformed our greatest weakness into our greatest opportunities, leading us to create an honest 360-degree picture of our business in the market. It hasn&#x2019;t been easy to call our own baby ugly, but it&#x2019;s necessary for a successful launch and to generate sustainable brand awareness.<strong>Every business has weaknesses&#x2014;it&#x2019;s harnessing them that matters</strong>When it comes to marketing, fuel&#x2014;or lack thereof&#x2014;is every startup&#x2019;s internal weakness. The majority of the time, entrepreneurs&#xA0;view weaknesses as an opportunity and a challenge that can be overcome with the right strategy. This attitude can propel the business forward (until it&#x2019;s are faced with a fuel shortage). Regardless of how strongly we believe in our new brand, an effective strategy to overcome vulnerabilities is vital to move the product forward.<strong>The greatest pains can become the greatest strengths </strong>Very few startups enter a space that isn&#x2019;t saturated by major players. Those who are able, spend millions of dollars to gather intelligent data used to attract, target, gain and maintain customers. These brands can offer higher quality products at a lower price and have better access to complex global distribution channels. Entrepreneurs must be extremely creative, industrious and look for unique ways to create something more meaningful and impactful to attract consumers.<strong>Strength comes from overcoming obstacles</strong>If we haven&#x2019;t lost you yet, you&#x2019;re probably an overconfident optimist like we are. Don&#x2019;t worry&#x2014;the spark is still there. A brand&#x2019;s internal strengths are what gets them up in the morning and keeps them going forward. Start-ups need to stay focused on their abilities rather than their inabilities to remain focused on the problem their product solves in the world. Product quality is our company&#x2019;s top priority. We know that by building a product based on customers wants and needs we can stand out in a saturated market. We&#x2019;re building a product established on people&#x2019;s real-life experiences, thoughts, wants and wishes. By building a product created around our target customer&#x2019;s ideals we can create a product they love and will recommend&#x2014;ensuring a community of brand loyalists. Virility around consumer feedback is the most powerful and cost effective marketing strategy that we could employ.<strong>&#xA0;</strong><strong>Find</strong> s<strong>uccess where preparation and opportunity meet</strong>Entrepreneurs are fueled by the opportunity to provoke change&#x2014;the idea that there is always a need for niche products and markets. The nature of some big companies is to appeal to the masses, offering a number of products often at the expense of quality. This can be confusing to customers, changing their perception of products and devaluing individual needs and desires. Our goal with our product is to speak directly to a targeted group of consumers to redefine the way most companies relate to them by appealing to the classes, not the masses. Analysis is a solid start, but it&#x2019;s only the foundation. The challenge is to take the insights gained and turn them into actionable strategies that are fiscally possible. Here is our uncommon sense guide for turning insights into actionable strategies that help build your new brand&#x2019;s engine: <strong>Listen. Listen. Then talk.</strong> We&#x2019;re listening to the needs of our potential customers and critically evaluating whether our products&#x2019; strengths meet those needs. For example, the customers we&#x2019;re targeting expect quality, so we are ensuring that our story and all of our marketing efforts highlight the quality of our products.<strong>What&#x2019;s learned along the way matters the most</strong>We look closely at what our competitors&#x2019; efforts. We monitor and admire noteworthy marketing successes and fails, learning valuable lessons along the way. For example, one of our competitors spends a good deal of money on celebrity spokesmodels, but sales have not translated from that spend. Trends have shown that celebrity endorsements don&#x2019;t pay off the way they used to. Customers today are more educated and it takes more than a star holding the product to gain brand loyalty.<strong>If opportunity doesn&#x2019;t knock build a door</strong>We&#x2019;ve studied disconnects in the market and are working diligently to bridge those gaps through brand-specific marketing that we can execute. By strategically targeting influencers (experts, executives, bloggers) to connect with our story and our products we&#x2019;re creating an authentic network that will endorse our message to their followers. We understand that staying relevant and visible is a daily effort and the only way we will continue to stay relevant is to cross-promote, network and stay authentic to our brand and our message. Generating an honest, 360-degree picture of your business isn&#x2019;t easy but it is necessary to successfully launch a product or service. When executed properly, the lessons learned can create a solid foundation for turning insights into actionable strategies&#x2014;which sets us up for our next chapter&#x2014;The Fuel.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

Is it the latest manifestation of the human spirit?Corporate giving is definitely not a new concept. Large companies and their leaders have been giving back for years, with billions of dollars donated to the arts, education, science and social issues. But today there&apos;s something new in the air, there&apos;s a movement of passionate and purpose-driven people who want to do more with their lives and their talents than just line their own pockets. A few years ago, consumers had little expectation that a company would give back. Most of us were certainly not buying products based on the social conscience or contributions of the companies selling us products. Something has changed considerably in the past few years where consumers can participate in making a difference through a wide range of products they purchase.The emergence of passionate, creative entrepreneurs and CEOs of large corporations who are combining passion, purpose and principles into very successful businesses are making a difference in the lives of those less fortunate and setting a new standard for the way business is done. This is the emergence of the new American spirit with entrepreneurs and companies orienting their talents and designing their businesses for good. Want to learn to infuse a socially and environmentally responsible nature into your brand in a way that will feel genuine and well-received by your target audience? This article is the first in a series that looks at creative thinkers who were made to give. With their ingeniously simple concepts, they are working to play a significant part in solving complex problems.<strong>FEED BAGS BY LAUREN BUSH:</strong> <em><strong>Channel your frustrations, put them up on the wall and look at them as a source of inspiration. It could lead you to the development of a business or the solution to a major issue. Use simplicity and brevity as filters for identifying and framing solutions to complex problems.</strong></em> World hunger is a far-away-and-doesn&apos;t-affect-me issue. As a student spokesperson in 2005 for the UN&apos;s World Food Program, Lauren Bush&apos;s job was to share the story of starving children in third world countries back on campus. Lauren was frustrated by the lack of tangible action she could encourage students to take, other than signing petitions.<em><strong>Small efforts can make a big difference. Strive to make your metrics for success easy to understand, such as Lauren&apos;s &apos;buy one bag and feed 3 children for a year&apos; messaging.</strong></em> As issues with plastic grocery bags were on the rise, Lauren used her talent as an emerging designer to create a reusable, stylish shopping bag as a fundraising tool. Combining brilliant simplicity and design, FEED Projects employs a very simple formula, buy a bag and you can positively impact the life of another person. FEED bags have provided more than 57 million meals through the sale of nearly 470,000 bags.<em><strong>Create opportunities for other brands and companies to partner with you around your products and causes.</strong></em> Lauren attributes her success to collaborative partnerships and the passion of others to engage in her brand &quot;I will always be so grateful to Whole Foods for their support in buying the first bag that made the biggest difference - sales from it helped feed the entire school population of RWANDA for an entire year!&quot; FEED has more recently partnered with GAP, HSN and Bergdorff Goodman, who donated an entire window on 5th Avenue in New York City to support the introduction of the Kenya burlap bag.<em><strong>Companies, teams and individuals possess a unique combination of talents that often go unexplored and are many times disconnected. Take the time to map both the passions and the talents of your team(s) and, as Sir Ken Robinson says, &quot;You might find your element.&quot;</strong></em> Inspired at an early age to care for the less fortunate by her mom, who used to take her to soup kitchens and started a charity for abused children, Lauren says, &quot;I had the double whammy of examples of giving back to others with my family in politics and service.&quot; Lauren is the Humanitarian Triple Threat: highly intelligent, empathetic humanitarian, designer and former model, who combined her talents and passion to design a business that engages women, raises awareness, and feeds starving children around the world.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"On our journeys through life, we occasionally encounter pivotal moments that alter our paths. My life changed when my mentor, Bob McDonald, challenged me to create a list of my values. This turned out to be one of the most difficult and eye-opening exercises I have ever had to complete.Bob is a student of leadership and firmly believes decision-makers should be guided by a personal set of values. When a leader is driven by clear values, hard decisions become easy and the leader&#x2019;s influence is broadened. Bob&#x2019;s method for helping people discover their key values is clear and simple, though certainly not easy:Sharing a list of my values with people was a scary proposition and it took some courage to follow through. But the reaction I received was very rewarding. Of course, not everybody agreed with my values, and that was okay. Because sometimes others feel like they better understand who you are and what you stand for.&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0;Now whenever I speak and am asked for my biography I share a two-page document with my bio on one side and my values on the other. Inevitably in the one-on-one Q&amp;A which always follows a talk, I get as many questions on my values as I do my talk.&#xA0;In my experience, authoring and sharing my personal values document has made, and continues to make, a powerful impact on my own life journey. I often review my values to make sure I&#x2019;m walking the talk. I don&#x2019;t always succeed, but whenever I fail I try to figure out why and learn from the experience. And when I&#x2019;m faced with a challenging decision, I review my list to find guidance on which choice will be most consistent with my values.&#xA0;I encourage you to try the process and see if it will help you make a greater impact in your life journey.You can read my detailed values document &#x201C;12 Things I Believe&#x201D; <a href=\"http://strengtheningbrandamerica.com/about-the-project/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. I&#x2019;ve also included an abbreviated list below, but I recommend downloading the complete list to more fully understand the exercise. These are my values, you don&#x2019;t have to agree with them but I hope they inspire you to consider your own values.<strong>12 THINGS I BELIEVE</strong><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"We write about the <a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/filter/company-culture#filters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">topic of culture</a> a lot. We believe a vibrant culture provides a collaborative environment for brands to thrive. <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/1810674/culture-eats-strategy-for-lunch\">Your brand is the single most important asset to differentiate you from your competitors consistently over time</a>. It needs to be nurtured, evolved and invigorated by the people entrusted to keep it true and alive. Without a functional and relevant culture, the money invested in research and development, product differentiation, marketing and human resources is never truly maximized and is often wasted because it&#x2019;s not fueled by a sustaining and functional culture.In our <a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/fueling-a-brand-with-good-energy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">conversation with Darcy Horn Davenport</a>, President of Premier Nutrition Corporation (PNC) we discussed the results of our recent brand positioning work together.At PNC, culture is a big deal. When you walk in the door you can instantly feel the good energy, the positivity and the passion their people emulate. Everyone at PNC is all-in. Their culture is built on four values that are the foundation the company sits on and the behavior that Darcy and her executive leadership team model.1) <strong>The PNC team are builders.</strong> They challenge the status quo and are constantly thinking about what&#x2019;s next and how to do it better.2) <strong>They are champions of positive nutrition.</strong> They encourage and support an active and healthy life for their customers and themselves.3) <strong>They are better together.</strong> They value each member of the team and know that success is only achievable through the team&#x2019;s collective efforts.4) <strong>They ring the bell.</strong> The PNC office has a cow bell that&#x2019;s used to celebrate the small victories as well as the big wins.To further strengthen these cultural tenets and inspire the PNC employees, Bulldog helped develop the PNC Builder Workshop Series. Each quarter, a thought leader is invited to the PNC office to lead a presentation and immersive session on an aspect of leadership and building a business or a brand. Neil Grimmer, Co-Founder of Plum Organics, talked about how he has been a &#x201C;builder&#x201D; in his successful career. And, Lucy Postins from The Honest Kitchen recently shared her experiences as an &#x201C;accidental entrepreneur&#x201D; and her relentless pursuit of positive pet nutrition.&#xA0;The idea behind this workshop series is to learn from others, give PNC employees a break from their day-to-day work and spark insight into how one can view work differently and make an impact on the world. The workshops have been very successful and have inspired countless PNC employees to approach their lives differently inside and outside of the office.As part of our branding work together, PNC launched &#x2018;The Year of Good Energy&#x2019;, which includes specific programs that support the company&#x2019;s purpose of Bringing Good Energy to the World. Most of PNC&#x2019;s employees are very passionate about philanthropy and Darcy wanted to foster a company culture that gives back to the communities where she and her team live, work and play&#x2014;and from this The Good Energy Give Back Program was born. PNC holds regular give back days, in which employees donate a half-day to give back to a local Bay Area charity or cause together, as a company. This summer, the entire PNC team went to Emerson Elementary School in Oakland to revamp the school&#x2019;s entire outdoor space. In addition, PNC has a Volunteer Grants Program that provides a monetary incentive for PNC employees to volunteer and an annual PNC company donation made to a charity of choice voted on by all PNC employees.Before working with Bulldog, PNC was already managing an amazing portfolio of healthy products and operating with good energy. They just needed a little help to bring this guiding principle to life&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s where Bulldog stepped in. PNC has always been a motivated team, but now they&#x2019;re inspired around a common purpose from which their company culture is building and growing.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Just out of college in 2003, Jason Russell and his buddies, Loren Poole and Bobby Bailey, decided they&#x2019;d use their newly acquired film-making talents to go to Sudan in search of the war. But that idea came to an abrupt end when they got there and found the war had ended. They&#xA0;decided to stay and hunt for another story and ended up in Gulu, Uganda where they tripped, camera-first, into the world&#x2019;s worst case of mass child abuse, abduction,&#xA0;murder, rape and torture. These three American film-makers stumbled on the horror of a community of children who would hide in tunnels and sewers at night to&#xA0;avoid being abducted into an army of brainwashed child soldiers.The story of how three young men founded Invisible Children illustrates six great tips for creating a company that is <em>made to give</em>:<strong>1. An amazing story moves hearts, minds and money</strong><br> Joseph Koney&#x2019;s LRA (Lord&#x2019;s Resistance Army) had been waging war against the Ugandan government and raping and plundering the villages of Northern Uganda&#xA0;for many years before Jason and his friends got there. Despite the UN being deeply involved, the world at large had no idea this war was being waged on children. Jason, Loren and Bobby became engaged in the tragedy because they could see themselves in the faces of these Ugandan children living in fear of&#xA0;their lives, and as a result, they made a commitment to the children of Gulu to tell their story.<strong>2. Use the talents and treasures you already have</strong><br> Jason, Loren and Bobby came back to the US and made a short documentary of their discovery and their commitment to end the war. They started touring the US, visiting hundreds of&#xA0;school campuses, sharing their story through the documentary, and inviting kids of all ages to engage and connect with the plight of the children in Uganda through their story. They gave out&#xA0;their DVD, raised money and awareness, and offered an invitation to the students on campus to hold parties to share the documentary and become part of the story and the solution.<strong>3. Seeing yourself in the story is a powerful motivator</strong><br> These creative activists have been on the forefront of developing and discovering what Jason calls 4D storytelling for the past five years and, in their quest to end a war on children in Uganda, they&#x2019;ve inspired, engaged and empowered millions of high school and college students to become part of a movement of&#xA0;storytellers and social activists&#x2014;and raised millions of dollars in the process.<strong>4. Good intentions are not enough, you&#x2019;ve got to act on them</strong><br> &#x201C;We promised them we&#x2019;d never stop until it was over,&#x201D; Jason explains. &#x201C;And we get up every day focused on one thing: ending the war.&#x201D; He&#x2019;s quick to point out&#xA0;that this is not a journey of sadness and bleeding hearts, but rather an everyday adventure that bounces you out of bed. &#x201C;We used to live in a world of self-interest,&#xA0;where you take care of yourself, and don&#x2019;t really care about the next person. We&#x2019;re all connected, and these kids in Gulu are our own. Our generation genuinely cares, and&#xA0;at Invisible Children we care enough to never give up.&#x201D;<strong>5. No risk, no reward</strong><br> Jason&#x2019;s dedication is undeniable and has landed him on the couches of the Oprah and Larry King Live shows. He believes that without risk there&#x2019;s no reward and,&#xA0;unlike the UN who has a zero risk policy, he&#x2019;s so passionate about seeing an end to this tragedy, that he&#x2019;s&#xA0;not giving up until it&#x2019;s finished. Invisible Children&#x2019;s risks have certainly reaped rewards. President Obama signed a bill into law as a result of Invisible Children&#x2019;s advocacy and&#xA0;relief work in Uganda, and millions of dollars have funded the support of the Gulu community for education and commerce and the rehabilitation of former child&#xA0;soldiers.<strong>6. Don&#x2019;t follow the rules and never underestimate the power of simplicity</strong><br> These champions of social justice are on the front lines of innovating new ways to raise awareness of injustice and are changing lives in the&#xA0;process, both in the US and overseas. Their tireless creativity, well-told stories, their own passion for ending injustice and their joy working with and motivating students has created a powerful movement for millennials. Their model of multi-dimensional storytelling allows people to engage in the issue through a&#xA0;connected campaign of digital media, social events, film and a tiered approach to giving and advocacy that has inspired and motivated many other not-for-profits.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

He has others which he would not reveal even to his friends, but only to himself, and that in secret. But finally there are still others which a man is even afraid to tell himself, and every decent man has a considerable number of such things stored away. That is, one can even say that the more decent he is, the greater the number of such things in his mind.&#x201D;<br><br>Let&#x2019;s be honest and admit that you and I aren&#x2019;t as awesome as we wish we were&#x2014;or our grandmas think we are. We&#x2019;re a dulled version of the persona we tout in interviews and on LinkedIn. Our lives are not as enviable or adventurous as our Instagram posts. The values and principles that are important to us aren&#x2019;t as realized in our lives as we would hope or as often as we wished.<br><br>In my mind, I&#x2019;m a really generous person&#x2014;but considering my time and fiscal donations over the past year, I know I could do better. In my heart, I&#x2019;m a compassionate person&#x2014;but more often than not, when a friend is sharing a sad story, my mind wanders and I know they can feel my disinterest.<br><br>Frankly, there&#x2019;s a difference between who I wish I was and how people experience me to be.<br><br>Companies have the same problem. A couple years ago I was booked on a flight on a big name airline and upon settling in at the gate, the attendant taking tickets told me that I was not, in fact, on the flight. For a confused moment I looked around, thinking maybe I was in the wrong place or perhaps here on the wrong date. I looked down to confirm that the information on my ticket matched that of the digital screen, and replied, &#x201C;Yes, actually I am. I am on this flight and I even have a seat, 26B&#x2014;just look again at my ticket.&#x201D; The woman, without empathy, briskly responded that my seat was not available. &#x201C;What do you mean?&#x201D; I asked. &#x201C;I have a ticket, confirmation, and I even have a seat reserved&#x2014;26B!&#x201D; Just then, the company&#x2019;s frontline representative came over and explained to me that their policy is to overbook each flight, with the assumption that not everyone will show up. Unfortunately that day, their policy backfired&#x2014;on me&#x2014;and there weren&#x2019;t enough seats for everyone. She offered no compassion in her eyes, no remorse in her tone, and didn&#x2019;t even utter an apology.<br><br>Stunned, I slowly walked back to the counter to reschedule my flight and I noticed an airline poster that read, &#x201C;Fly on your schedule with over 5,000 daily flights. Fly the friendly skies.&#x201D; This had to be a joke. We all know, with the exception of one noticeably different exception (Southwest), that there&#x2019;s nothing friendly about the experience you&#x2019;ll have as a customer of those airlines, and rarely will anything be on your schedule.<br><br>When it comes to branding, companies ought to spend a lot of attention on developing clarity&#x2014;clarity of purpose, values, priorities and principles. Unfortunately, it&#x2019;s pretty rare to find a company, or a person, who has reached any level of clarity.<br><br>But what&#x2019;s even more important is for someone&#x2019;s experience of that brand to consistently match the stated slogans. If I&#x2019;m conducting an interview with someone and they tell me that they&#x2019;re really dedicated and passionate, but the vibe I receive is reserved or distant, then I won&#x2019;t believe them. If a company says they focus on quality, but the dude making my burrito is sloppy and the tortilla falls apart, then my trust for what they say is going in a negative direction. Their promise is inauthentic.<br><br>The brands that we love have the magical ability to back up what they say. And if they don&#x2019;t, then they own the gap, apologize, and make it right.<br><br>Similarly, the people that we love can look you in the eye, tell you who they are, offer stories from their past the give evidence of that to be true, and then back up their promises with consistency.<br><br>So what about you or your company? Are you who you say you are or claim to be? Do people experience you in a way that matches how you wish they would?<br><br>Don&#x2019;t assume that you know the answers. Find out, with a few Bulldog Uncommon Sense steps:<br><br>1. First, clarify what&#x2019;s most important to you and what you want to be known for.<br><br>2. Find out what you&#x2019;re actually known for. Ask 5 people who know you well (family, friends or co-workers), &#x201C;What are the two words you use to describe me?&#x201D;<br><br>3. Regularly seek feedback after conversations, meetings and encounters. Ask questions like, &#x201C;Being engaged as a good listener is important to me&#x2014;how did I do when we had that conversation? What did I do that made you feel like I was engaged, and what could I have done differently? What was your experience of being with me?&#x201D;<br><br>You&#x2019;re not always going to be understood or appreciated for being true to yourself.

Both the food and the personal service were world-class, faultless, and outstanding. In fact everything you&#x2019;d expect from Chef Ramsay. I was particularly taken by the seamless interaction of house staff and their down-to-earth connection with the guests. They were experts in their area of service, but as friendly and kind-hearted as a good friend. A&#xA0;spectacular experience, and absolutely no doubt I will return on my next trip to London.Having watched Ramsay&#x2019;s role as a passionate and colorful television personality, I&#x2019;ve always respected his ability to accurately critique, break down, and rebuild underperforming or poorly positioned restaurants with his signature blunt critique and the standards at which he holds others. You don&#x2019;t get 3 stars without fanatical attention to excellence.While dining for four hours I had reason to visit the lav on two occasions, and while standing reflecting on the whole experience, something didn&#x2019;t quite sit right with me. As I often do, I was thinking about&#xA0;every part of the experience, the front of house was near perfection. The Ma&#xEE;tre D invited us to tour the kitchen, how could I not be impressed. But&#xA0;on my two visits to the restroom I noticed a lack of attention to excellence in the details. While the bathroom was spotlessly clean, the wallpaper was peeling at the base of the skirting boards, paint was sloppy around the urinal tiles, the sink was bog standard, and the marble countertop unspectacular at best. I have no doubt every other bloke goes in, urinates, and leaves but I couldn&#x2019;t help thinking about Ramsay&#x2019;s fanaticism for detail and excellence, and how these details got past his eagle eye. Bathrooms say everything about a restaurant, so it made me wonder, when was the last time he was here, when was the last time he looked at his own establishment the same way he does at others? This is his flagship. I think it&#x2019;s time for a bog remodel Gordon.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"One of first things Stephanie Burns said to me when I interviewed her for a job at Bulldog Drummond a few years ago was that one day she wanted to own her own company. About five years later she&#x2019;s done just that. <a href=\"http://www.chic-ceo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Chic CEO</a> is&#xA0;a free web resource for female entrepreneurs that provides all of the foundational and fundamental information women need to start a business, from how to write a business plan to the steps to take if they have invented a product. Finances, funding, and marketing&#x2014;Chic CEO has got it covered. Together with her business partner Jody Coughlin, Stephanie has created a platform for women to find the answers to help them make their dream a reality.In grad school Stephanie sat through classes thinking, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m in business school, but if someone asked me how to start a business&#x2014;step 1, step 2, step 3&#x2014;I would have no idea what to tell them.&#x201D; So she started looking for resources. At the same time, a lot of her girlfriends were starting small businesses and couldn&#x2019;t find resources either. These smart, stylish, savvy women needed not only information, but for that information to be user-friendly. Stephanie got fifteen of her friends together over a glass of wine, confirmed her intuition, and found her niche. Her goal was to help women start their business in a manner that is easy and seamless.Fast-forward to today; Stephanie is receiving thank-you emails from women who stumble on her site. A woman in Dubai who researched the steps for starting a business for eight months recently joined the new membership program, and found that she could finally concentrate on her business instead of how to get it started.Today, women are starting businesses at a 2:1 rate over men, and they need a resource they can trust. It&#x2019;s not surprising that the brand is gaining traction.&#xA0;Chic CEO not only provides the answers women are looking for (for free) but they say it feels like they&#x2019;re talking to a friend. It has a distinct voice for women starting businesses. Stephanie and her partner believe that the line between personal and business has blurred. They&#x2019;re not afraid to tell their users how pretty they are while talking about balance sheets.&#xA0;What I respect about Stephanie is that she doesn&#x2019;t claim to be a business expert, but she prides herself on being tenacious enough to find the necessary answers&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s the heart of Chic CEO. They won&#x2019;t tell you how to make a million dollars, but they will find the answers so you can!When building a business, a person learns a lot about themselves and others along the way, and Stephanie is no exception. She learned that she has a tender heart, she hates being told what to do (I could have told her that years ago),&#xA0;and she&#x2019;s learned to ask for help. One of the best tools she has learned is to not be afraid to ask for what she wants&#x2014;she found out early on that if she just asks, nine times out of ten the answer is <em>yes</em>. Now, her team asks away and isn&#x2019;t fazed by a <em>no</em>. &#x201C;We have mustered up the courage to ask for some of the craziest things only to find ourselves at a yes,&#x201D; says Stephanie.Courage plays a major part on the journey of building a business&#x2014;courage to stand up for what you&#x2019;ve created, to believe in its value and to continue moving forward. Stephanie knows failure is certain if she quits, so she keeps going. One day at a time, one decision at a time. Courage doesn&#x2019;t mean always being right. &#x201C;You have to know that you can&#x2019;t control everything, and some things simply won&#x2019;t work. Courage is when you take what you&#x2019;ve learned and try it again. It&#x2019;s not easy, but can yield amazing results.&#x201D;If you&#x2019;re thinking about starting a business, whether you&#x2019;re a woman or a man, Stephanie has some good advice, &#x201C;Just get started, you&#x2019;ll figure out the rest.&#x201D; Like every&#xA0;practical woman, she puts an emphasis on recognizing your low moment, &#x201C;Understand when you&#x2019;re at a low, when you are out of energy and inspiration, but hopefully not out of money. These moments are certain in a startup&#x2014;they weed out the weak from the strong. When you&#x2019;re able to recognize it&#x2019;s just part of the process and not a reason to quit, you&#x2019;ll know you&#x2019;re light years ahead of those ready to quit. It&#x2019;s important to surround yourself with people who believe in you and what you are building.&#xA0;Don&#x2019;t be afraid to lean on people during these moments, for brutal honesty, advice, guidance and to remind you what value you&#x2019;re bringing to the world.&#x201D; And as you&#x2019;d expect, she recommends doing the research, reading everything, and using free resources like Chic CEO. There is a wealth of information available, so there&#x2019;s no need to recreate the wheel.Today Stephanie has big plans for her female-focused business. She wants to become the number one trusted resource for female entrepreneurs and expand, providing ground level business information in other categories like investing, PR, non-profit, and networking. In addition she would eventually love to create a venture arm that invests in women-led businesses.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "principle":"BRANDS ARE LIKE PEOPLE AND PEOPLE ARE LIKE BRANDS",
       "content_body":"Almost every entrepreneur and founder I&#x2019;ve had the pleasure of working with is brilliant in their own unique way. They see a problem or gap in the market and they create a compelling product, technology or service for an unmet need; and then with passion, vision, courage, and conviction they set out to build a company to solve those needs. They&#x2019;re part of a fearless and inspiring bunch. By the time they come to us, they&#x2019;ve usually got a solid idea about the problem they want to solve or&#xA0;the product they want to build.&#xA0;Most have thought through the mechanics of how they might build their product, and every single one of them brings an infectious amount of optimism and urgency for their venture.Most of the time what&#x2019;s missing is a lack of knowledge around how to articulate and share the value of what they&#x2019;ve built or are planning to build. There&#x2019;s often a focus on the wrong tools needed and a general lack of knowledge around what is involved in building a brand. Many think a logo is the most important element they need, while others have fallen in love with using a forgettable, disconnected or difficult name for their product or service. The most successful entrepreneurs I know are the ones who are fanatical about what they know and are equally honest and open about what they don&#x2019;t know. Understanding the power and dimensions of brand is often at the top of the &#x201C;don&#x2019;t know&#x201D; list. So for those building a start-up here&#x2019;s a simple framework that we follow when building a brand.<strong>Brand is?</strong><br> Brand is not a logo, a tagline or an advertising campaign. It&#x2019;s a multi-dimensional platform that can be your greatest differentiator and competitive edge if built correctly. It represents both a rational and emotional connection to your various stakeholders and the consumer that ultimately decides to purchase and engage with you. It&#x2019;s important to understand and deploy the power of a fully developed brand.<strong>Clearly define what business you&#x2019;re in&#xA0;</strong><br> It&#x2019;s the first question, the one to start with, and the one to answer with careful thought. And it&#x2019;s not always the first answer you give. &#x201C;What business are you in?&#x201D; should lead you to understand the broader value you&#x2019;re going to offer the world. It is the fundamental question that should inform others why you exist, while helping mold your vision and purpose. When we ask this simple question to the founders of startups and senior executives of large and established multinational corporations, they realize that when they answer it correctly and imaginatively they unlock new value and potential for their brand.<strong>Build a rock solid brand platform</strong><br> Think of your brand platform as the foundation that directs and informs every aspect of your business. A platform that&#x2019;s crystal clear and unshakable should include&#xA0;a clear vision statement that outlines, in simple terms, an aspirational view of the impact you&#x2019;re planning to make in the world. It should include a purpose statement that informs how you plan to deliver on the vision. What most businesses skip is a set of operating principles, or values that guide behaviors and decisions. With these foundational elements in place, you should clearly outline the personality traits of the brand to inform the development of your products, identity and communications. Take each of these elements and ladder everything back to the purpose and you&#x2019;ll keep everything about your brand cohesive and connected.<strong>Design an identity that you&#x2019;d be proud to wear on a t-shirt</strong><br> Working from the brand platform, informed and inspired by your larger purpose,&#xA0;you&#x2019;re now equipped to name your brand deliberately. Working from the brand principles and personality traits, you have the inspiration points and guardrails to direct the development of a brand identity that should break through and stand out in your category.&#xA0;Your identity and the design language that surrounds your brand is a worthwhile investment given the importance of design in most categories of business today. It&#x2019;s important to understand the added value and quality cues that design can add to your competitive edge.<strong>Tell a compelling story</strong><br> Developing and sharing a compelling brand narrative is like crafting and telling a really good story. You want other people to hear it and want to share it. To start, prepare an outline that&#x2019;s informed by your purpose and your business strategy. The characters in your story and how you tell it should be guided by your principles and personality traits. When it comes to crafting the stories, find a consistent voice for your brand and test it out to make sure it resonates. When it comes to sharing your story, think like an editor of a magazine, and program out the chapters or the various aspects of the story with an editorial calendar to ensure you manage the delivery and the timing in a coordinated manner. They say people don&#x2019;t read today, which I don&#x2019;t agree with, so make sure you&#x2019;ve got something interesting, relevant and memorable to say.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

FORTUNE called Watson Jr.&#x2019;s investment &#x201C;IBM&#x2019;s $5,000,000,000 Gamble.&#x201D; For IBM to make an equivalent investment today, it would have to spend $137,000,000,000 on a single product, so revolutionary that it would obsolete not only its entire install base of mainframes but the intellectual capital of every single one of its major competitors: the likes of Intel, Hewlett Packard and Accenture. It was a risk of outsized proportions unmatched by any corporation&#x2013;even to this day.<strong>Two chief executives require two different scales to measure rewards</strong>&#xA0;<span class=\"s1\">Kevin Maney in&#xA0;<em>The Maverick and his Machine</em>&#xA0;writes about the luck of Watson Sr., the traditional founder of IBM. There is a chapter entitled &#x201C;Daring and Luck.&#x201D; One of Watson Sr.&#x2019;s favorite dogs was named Lucky. Maney writes that &#x201C;Watson had luck by the boatload.&#x201D; In 1956, at the end of Watson Sr.&#x2019;s forty-two years with IBM, corporate employment stood at 56,000, revenue at&#xA0;$700 million, and net income at $73 million. Yet, the individual who manufactured even more luck than Watson Sr. was Watson Jr. He delivered results on a scale that even his father would have considered unimaginable.</span><span class=\"s1\">Instead of taking four decades, Watson Jr. added on average 56,000 employees every four years, $700 million in revenue almost every year and a half, and $73 million in net income almost every year. In a decade and a half, revenue per employee grew by 150%, net income per employee by more than 200%, and the number of stockholders by more than 2,000%. In 1974, while reminiscing in an interview with&#xA0;<em>THINK Magazine</em>&#xA0;about the success of the mainframe effort, IBM&#x2019;s former Chief Executive Officer, Watson Jr., commented, &#x201C;Of course, we had some luck.&#x201D;</span>Watson Sr. sometimes used the word luck too, but neither he nor his son would have attributed their corporate successes to chance. They were always pushing their corporation to be prepared for its next opportunity. For Watson Jr., his opportunity was computers.<strong>Although he called it luck, it wasn&#x2019;t by chance</strong>Watson Jr., as soon as he took over as chief executive, called what he meant to be a &#x201C;constitutional convention&#x201D; of his top leadership. He decentralized decision making; he replaced his father&#x2019;s autocracy with autonomy and used his corporation&#x2019;s greatest asset&#x2014;its belief system&#x2014;to avoid anarchy. He simplified the belief system to three memoriable words: <strong>respect</strong> for the individual; <strong>service</strong> to the customer; and the pursuit of <strong>excellence</strong>. Through this belief system, Watson Jr. enforced his authority without being autocratic, as he too was subject to its judgements. In 1962, he elaborated on the benefits of this belief system, it brought out the great energies and talents of IBM&#x2019;s people, helped them find common cause, and kept them pointed in the right direction.Watson Jr. then invested $5,000,000,000 to make people more productive, processes more effective and products more valuable. He challenged every individual to be a wild duck&#x2014;a man or woman who wouldn&#x2019;t be tamed or shamed into being a &#x201C;company man&#x201D;. He told his management team that all of this autonomy would make them feel uncomfortable, but that encouraging individual thought and empowering individual action was the only way to achieve the growth they wanted to achieve. One of the individuals who heard the call was William W. Simmons.Instead of accepting the forecast that revenue growth would slow he took independent action to ensure his corporation was prepared to meet its new opportunity in computers.<strong>When employees manufacture personal luck, it makes for an extremely lucky corporation</strong>Simmons, an employee and author of <em>Inside IBM: The Watson Years</em>, conducted a pilot program and discovered that within 90 days after a sales representative received an industry-specific education there was a 20% rise in revenue. So, his sales organization realigned its entire sales force within fifteen industries and sent them to industry-specific education. In the insurance industry, for example, the sales reps received two to four weeks of Rutgers University training. By the end of 1963&#x2014;just in time for the announcement of the mainframe&#x2014;two out of every three sales representatives were trained and selling into their industry specialty. IBM gained market share in all industries. Its share of the insurance industry market grew to an incredible 88.5%.Although Bill Simmons was exceptional, he was one of thousands who were similarly motivated by a leader who encouraged, emboldened and rewarded individual action.<strong>For maximum success, a chief executive should encourage employees to float their own boats</strong>I feel that I am the luckiest man in the business world. &#x2026; because every member &#x2026; has always given to this business the best that he has had to give. It is that cooperation and coordination of effort on the part of the people in every department &#x2026; that has built IBM. &#x2014;Watson Sr., IBM Homestead, 1947The Watsons <em>were</em> lucky, but they weren&#x2019;t gamblers, they were businessmen. They practiced the business definition of luck: the point at which preparation intersects with opportunity. Watson Jr.&#x2019;s type of luck left little to chance, because he found a way to exponentially magnify his father&#x2019;s boatload of luck. Watson Jr. created a work environment that encouraged all employees to float their own boats&#x2013;loaded up with luck.If you are trying to outgrow your entrepreneurial limitations, does your work environment encourage employees to form vast armadas that constantly scan the horizon for your corporation&#x2019;s next opportunity? Are you bringing out the great energies and talents of your people?&#xA0;<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"I&#x2019;ve been a fanatical list writer for as long as I can remember. In fact, I write out two pages of to-dos each day and rewrite my goals and dreams for life and business every week. If you consider that a little obsessive, then you&#x2019;re spot on. I believe if you don&#x2019;t have dreams and goals mapped out, then you&#x2019;ll never achieve them. And while the act of writing them down doesn&#x2019;t guarantee that they&#x2019;ll happen, it helps you to stay laser focused on the things that matter and prevents you from drifting from year to year hoping things might change. Because my goals are outlined weekly, I find it&#x2019;s easy to transfer them to annual goals at the end of each year. But one additional task I love to do is map out principles that I&#x2019;m going to explore during the year ahead so I don&#x2019;t go through the year on the same path as the previous years. I want to grow in the ways in which I think and engage with others throughout each new year.<span>Here are ten Uncommon Sense principles for the year ahead that I hope inspire you to think about how you&#x2019;ll grow throughout 2015.</span><strong>1. START STRONG, FINISH STRONG<br></strong>Start your new year by designing a meaningful event to kick it off both at home and at work. Celebrate the beginning of this exciting new chapter that you can fill with opportunities, new experiences and people who will add richly to your life. Start the year off with renewed energy, passion and intentionality. You&#x2019;ll remember the year if you don&#x2019;t just roll from last year into the new one.<strong>2. BUILD YOUR OWN ADVISORY BOARD&#xA0;<br></strong>Who do you go to for candid feedback and advice? Who are you accountable to? It&#x2019;s time to form your own board of advisors and let them hold you accountable. Identify three or four people whom you respect in different facets of your life and invite them onto your board. Set expectations and let them know you need them on your journey through the year. Set up a monthly call or coffee with each of them and ask them to help hold you to your annual plan.<strong>3.&#xA0;HOW ARE YOU DOING (REALLY)?<br></strong>You grow through life when you live it consciously and are aware of the impact you have on others around you. We ask our customers what they think of our products and sit through performance reviews at work, but when was the last time you put a survey together and asked your spouse, your kids, your friends and your closest colleagues to give you written feedback on how you&#x2019;re doing, how you impact them and what you can do to help make their lives better. A great way to know how to grow is to know where to focus. Try a survey or two and become consciously aware of your most important relationships.<strong>&#xA0;</strong><strong>&#xA0;</strong><strong>4. STOP, START, MUST-DOs<br></strong>Seeking simplicity in life is one way to create the margin of time, but daily life seems to get more complex every year and time can slip through our hands like sand. One simple exercise is to list the things that you need to stop doing in the year ahead. List the distractions, the time-wasters and the headache-inducers with the reasons why&#x2014;these are your STOPS for 2015. Then make a list of the things you&#x2019;d like to start doing, the things you&#x2019;ve talked about for a long time but have never gotten to, the really important things that never make the list&#x2013;&#x2013;and write down the reasons why. These are your STARTS for 2015. Then there are those things you must continue doing. These are your MUST DOs for 2015. Take the time to do this exercise, it&#x2019;s liberating, will help you focus and it will give you back time in 2015.<strong>5. FIND THE MEANING IN EVERYTHING&#xA0;<br></strong>I feel privileged to work with some of the smartest executives in the world, and have the honor of facilitating meetings with hundreds of people each year. I see a huge opportunity for so many to put a clear sense of purpose and context behind what they get up to do every day. Designing your actions with purpose and intentionality is an opportunity to inject more satisfaction into your days (and nights). If you can answer the question &#x201C;Why am I here and why am I spending my time doing this?&#x201D; you&#x2019;ll waste less of your valuable time in the year ahead. Design your days with intentionality.<strong>&#xA0;</strong><strong>6. LOVE CONQUERS ALL, SO CAN YOU<br></strong>Starting your day off with a sense of gratitude for the life you live, the people you spend it with and the country you live in is a great way to tee up your attitude to positively impact those around you. They say it&#x2019;s easier to smile than to frown and easier to be kind than to be mean-spirited. My friend <a href=\"http://bobgoff.com/\">Bob Goff</a> wrote a bestselling book titled <a href=\"http://bobgoff.com/love-does/\"><em>Love Does</em></a> that&#x2019;s filled with stories of spontaneous love and laughter. Be deliberate about designing acts of kindness for the people you care about. Buy a stranger a cup of coffee in the line at Starbucks. Say thank you more often. Give love a go.<strong>7. SMALL GESTURES GO A LONG WAY<br></strong>My wife recently reminded me that it&#x2019;s the small gestures, rather than the grand ones, that make a difference over the long-term. It&#x2019;s the every day, run-of-the-mill, important but sometimes mundane acts that show you understand other people&#x2019;s needs and that you care about what they need from you. Make a point of asking and understanding what&#x2019;s really important to the people you live with and work with. Make it all about them, not all about you.<strong>8. SHUT UP AND LISTEN MORE<br></strong>How many meetings have you been in where you watch the flow of a conversation? People repeat what the last person just said, but with slightly different words. The question that just got asked was completely ignored in favor of someone else wanting to make his or her point. As human beings, we waste so much time talking about meaningless crap because we&#x2019;re not really engaged in a two-way conversation or more, we&#x2019;re in our own monologue and think that being heard is more important than listening. Try being the quiet one in the room and listening a whole lot more than you talk. Ask more pointed questions and see what reactions you get and the impact that approach has on your own productivity. Quiet confidence creates intrigue.<strong>&#xA0;</strong><strong>9. BOLD STRATEGY. CONSISTENT COMMUNICATION. FLAWLESS EXECUTION.<br></strong>Define and cement your purpose and what you want to get done in 2015. Map a clear and bold strategy for the most important initiatives you&#x2019;ll embark upon. Create your mission and share it with your team, the consumer and your partners. Know what you&#x2019;re going to focus on and then execute against it flawlessly. Get your team together, cook them breakfast, serve them burgers and tell them what you&#x2019;re doing, and why and how you&#x2019;re going to do it. Communicate successes, failures, rockstar moments and misses. Do this often, celebrate the small wins and share the losses. Remember, actions speak louder than words.<strong>10. WHO ARE YOUR PEOPLE?<br></strong>Make sure to put people at the center of everything you do. It&#x2019;s not about you, it&#x2019;s not about profits and it&#x2019;s not about products. Passionate, engaged people move mountains. Enough said. Turn up the love on your people. Understand them. Know them. Thank them. Communicate with them and involve them often. &#xA0;<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "principle":"ALWAYS BE LEARNING",
       "content_body":"I believe 80% of what I know about being on a team and leading a team comes from my some 20 years as an athlete. The willingness to sit through discomfort, how to work with teammates one loves and others one loathes, and the ability to dissect a strategy to find a weakness in a competitor are all skills honed after tens of thousands of hours on a track, court or field. The basic tenants of athletics though are some of the most valuable lessons athletes take with them beyond the field. Those basics are usually learned in the first few games of a young athletes life, yet sticks with them for a lifetime.One day as I sat and watched my cousin take the field with a cadre of other five year olds for their first soccer game and I was completely inspired. They swarmed around the ball like a mass of bees moving and pulsing in amazing chaos threating to engulf anything and anyone who came to close. They tromped around in jerseys far to big for such tiny humans, but approached the game with an unrivaled joy and zeal. The game they played was a distant relative of the professional games being played that very same day, but the growth that took place during that one game was far more profound. Lessons learned from the field that day are the same ones we sometimes need to relearn and remember ourselves.<strong>Aim where the ball is going not where it is<br> </strong>Just minutes into the game a number of miniature players wildly swung their legs at a moving ball and missed. After just a few failed attempts the message was clear: I have to aim my kick where the ball is traveling to and not where it is at this exact moment. The fact is the same, as we grow older. We can&#x2019;t run to where the ball was. Someone not only might&#x2014;but will&#x2014;kick it farther down the field. Never run to where the market is now, run where it is going.&#xA0;<strong>Listen to the right person</strong><br> Standing on the sidelines of the game I realized the players hear about 30 people screaming directions. Coaches, parents and other players line the edge of the field cheering their player or team along. They scream directions. They scream encouragement. The really negative ones scream frustrations, but no mater what they add to the noise of what the players hear. Learning to filter through the noise and listening to the coach&#x2019;s voice as their guiding voice of reason is an invaluable skill. But as we grow it&#x2019;s easy to forget to listen to the right person or persons, and it&#x2019;s even harder as it is to identify who the right person is. Take time to decide who the right people are and filter out the noise.<strong>It takes a team</strong><br> No one can&#x2019;t do it alone. It took all the players on the field participating to score a goal. The coaches highlighted and celebrated the role of each player&#x2014;no matter how small it was. Similarly, it&#x2019;s important to remember that no matter how great one individual is, it takes a team to execute a plan and eventually drive business forward.<strong>Know where you are aiming<br> </strong>Before the game began the coaches lined up players in front of their goal with the clear message that this is our goal and we don&#x2019;t let the ball go in here. Then they pointed to the other goal and said that&#x2019;s where we want the ball to go. The beauty of a soccer field for these players was the clear two-fold purpose. Each player on the team understood their objective. Later there was some confusion on which goal belonged to which team and lead to a few laughs. Portraying that having clear alignment and directions are paramount to completing an objective.&#xA0;<strong>Mistakes happen, try again<br></strong>Perhaps the most critical lesson learned that day was the way players tried and failed, then succeeded, then failed, but they never stopped to dwell on a goal scored or opportunity missed.&#xA0; The willingness to try again and again becomes increasingly harder as the stakes grow larger, but the lesson to learn and grow from failure is incredibly important. The athletes on the field that day knew what everyone must remember mistakes happen shake them off and get back out there and try again.<strong>&#xA0;</strong>Businesses, leaders, and employees alike can benefit from approaching situations like a child. Just as these five year olds approached their game, no matter the implications by remembering to aim for the right goal, listen to the right people, work with a team, know where you&#x2019;re going, and bounce back from mistakes when you fail. Will provide a foundation for success. I try each day to play the game the way those five year olds did that day; fearless, unrelenting, and a huge smile on my face. I just hope there are orange slices at half time.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"I&#x2019;ve admired Southwest Airlines for many years, and I&#x2019;ve cited them as a company with a clear focus, a vibrant soul, and a culture you can see in all areas of their business. And as a frequent business traveler, I made them my preferred domestic airline many years ago. Given my professional respect for them, it was a real honor to be invited to speak at their recent management conference. I appreciated their genuine hospitality (I was hugged quite a lot), their pride and love for their company, and was impressed by the investment they make in people.At the same time, I had the pleasure of getting to know the other speaker at the event, <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jay-heinrichs/7/b42/519\" target=\"_blank\">Jay Heinrichs</a>. He&#x2019;s an author, persuasion consultant, and raconteur, and his energy and presence were unique and intriguing. Southwest curated the content for their team and chose two key subjects (and speakers) that were diametrically opposed in almost every way. I spoke on &#x201C;Designing Random Acts of Kindness&#x201D; and Jay spoke on &#x201C;How to Screw Up&#x201D;. He believes there&#x2019;s much to be learned from mistakes, mishaps, and screwing up, and given we live in a world where people and companies do all they can to paint a picture of perfection, I was intrigued by Jay&#x2019;s perspective on screwing up as a business discipline.After talking with Jay, it&#x2019;s clear he&#x2019;s uniquely qualified, both as an expert on rhetoric, master in the art of persuasion, and by his own self-admission, as a lifelong bungler. He admits lacking any sense of direction, and suffers from an extreme case of absent-mindedness, which according to Jay made for a pretty awkward dating life. He thanks rhetoric for helping him overcome his handicaps, and despite himself, is married to a good woman for life.Jay&#x2019;s first significant encounter with screwing up professionally happened when he accidentally misplaced a volcano. Just out of college Jay was working at a conservation magazine, when Mount St. Helens started smoking. He wrote an article about how this previously inactive volcano in Oregon had suddenly become active. It was one of the first articles he ever got published. Jay didn&#x2019;t realize his error until an envelope with the official Washington State seal arrived on his desk. Inside was a letter from Governor Dixy Lee Ray, asking for her volcano back. Jay had screwed up and put the mountain in the wrong state, a humiliating error for a budding journalist. Frantic to come up with a solution, he walked into his boss&#x2019;s office, showed him the letter and shared his plan. &#x201C;How about buying a volcano&#x2014;plastic, bronze, whatever&#x2014;and presenting it to her?&#x201D; &#x201C;No&#x201D;, the editor-in-chief said. &#x201C;A mistake does not earn you a trip to the West Coast. But go ahead and find a volcano. Then just mail it.&#x201D; So Jay mailed it. And some weeks later, he received a photo of the governor posing with the volcano in one hand and his magazine in the other. They printed the photo with a correction in the next issue. Jay&#x2019;s boss was so happy about the outcome that, when Mount St. Helens exploded sometime later, he sent Jay to write the cover story. And that&#x2019;s when he realized that a screw up doesn&#x2019;t have to ruin your life. In fact, if you respond in a smart way, you can learn from the mistake and often turn a negative into a positive.If you ask Jay what is his favorite screw up story, he&#x2019;ll tell you it&#x2019;s Bill Clinton. He thinks the man made a historic ass of himself. But in the spirit of how to screw up masterfully, Clinton has been a master. Look at how during his challenges, he continually shifted the focus to the future and moved on. Today, Bill Clinton has newfound respect as he puts his exceptional intellect and statesmanship to work helping to solve some of the world&#x2019;s most significant issues. If you ask Jay who and what inspired his thinking around screwing up, he&#x2019;ll tell you in a New York minute, Aristotle. Jay is an expert on all things surrounding Aristotle&#x2019;s rhetoric and logic.<strong>What does Aristotle have to do with screwing up?</strong><br> Aristotle wrote the original book on persuasion: <em>Rhetoric.</em> All persuasion books that have been written in the 2,600 years since stem from Aristotle&#x2019;s ideas. Aristotle offers two important tools that apply to recovering from screw ups.First, Aristotle said that the most important tool of persuasion&#x2014;even more important than logic&#x2014;is &#x201C;ethos&#x201D;, which has to do with getting an audience to like and trust you. The ideal ethos, or projected image of yourself, displays craft (authority with the subject at hand, and an ability to apply that knowledge to specific situations), caring (whether you&#x2019;re interested only for your audience&#x2019;s benefit), and cause (whether you stand for something larger than yourself). After a screw up, you need to present a workable plan to show your craft. Emphasize that you&#x2019;re putting all hands on deck, doing whatever it takes, and staying up all night to fix the problem. That&#x2019;s the caring part. As for cause, point out that you have high standards and that you plan to live up to them.The second tool is &#x201C;tense&#x201D;. Aristotle said that there are three types of persuasion, each having to do with a different tense. The past is about crime and punishment, about screw ups that happened in the past. The present has to do with values, with right and wrong, who&#x2019;s good and who&#x2019;s bad. Then there&#x2019;s the future, where you talk about the expected outcomes of decisions and choices. Want to get someone to make a decision? Focus on the future.Jay got all that from Aristotle&#x2014;who, by the way, tutored a young lad named Alexander. Little Alexander took these same tools of persuasion, created a volunteer army, and conquered the known world. He earned himself the title Alexander the Great. If it worked for him, then it&#x2019;s likely that it will work for anyone&#x2019;s screw ups.<strong><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/34120957@N04/4199675334/\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3749\" title=\"HowtoScrewUp_2\" src=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/HowtoScrewUp_21.jpg\" alt width=\"395\" height=\"278\"></a></strong><strong>Apply it to Tim Cook and Bank of America</strong><br> The Apple Maps debacle was a significant test in how the post-Jobs Apple would behave in a pinch. From Heinrichs&#x2019; perspective, Tim Cook handled the Apple Maps disappointment badly because he apologized. People thought they wanted an apology from Apple, but that&#x2019;s not really the case. The iPhone 5 hit the market and the negative press about the new Maps application tarnished the invincibility of Apple. Cook apologized for the lousy new application and instantly fired Eric Forstall, the man in charge of Maps, allegedly because he refused to sign an apology. Apple&#x2019;s stock took an immediate beating. Had Cook applied Heinrichs rules and emphasized Apple&#x2019;s high standards, mentioned that the company had temporarily failed to live up to them, and then focused on how the Maps would soon be even cooler than people imagined, the fallout would have been different. Cook should have said that Apple is putting all hands on deck, the most talented people in the world to get it fixed. And he should have hinted at what to expect. No apology needed. Shift to the future, emphasize craft, caring, and cause, and watch the results change. If only Cook had been as experienced at screwing up as Jay Heinrichs.A couple years ago Bank of America outsourced 100 tech-support jobs to India&#x2014;and told the fired workers they had to train their replacements to get severance checks. The bank got well-deserved terrible publicity. How should the managers have handled the screw up? First, they should have recognized their mistake and reported it to the press as quickly as possible, explaining the reason for outsourcing and giving the fired workers their checks immediately. Second, they should have shifted the focus to the future, promising improved efficiency and better service to customers. And while the workers themselves deserved an apology, it should have been done in private. A public apology only makes a company look smaller. Fix the problem and focus on a better future.<strong>Rules for a proper screw up</strong><br> As I got to know Jay Heinrichs I couldn&#x2019;t help but think of how similar his name is to Henry Jay Heimlich, the American physician who invented abdominal thrusts more commonly known as the Heimlich Maneuver. I wonder if Heinrichs&#x2019; rules for a screw up will become as helpful, and ultimately as famous for helping companies manage significant mistakes in their system.<strong>Here are the rules:</strong><strong>1. Be first with the news if you can.&#xA0;</strong><br> You will gain much better control of the matter if the bad news comes straight from you. Plus, right after delivering the news, you can show that you&#x2026;<strong>2. Have a plan.&#xA0;</strong><br> People get over the shock of your screw up quickly if you show you have a way to fix it. But don&#x2019;t wait to offer the plan. Present it immediately after giving the news.<strong>3. Shift to the future.&#xA0;</strong><br> Focus on what happens next. That&#x2019;s what Clinton did.<strong>4. Don&#x2019;t apologize.&#xA0;</strong><br> This is the most controversial advice Heinrichs gives. Apologies come with several problems. First, they focus on the past, on the screw up, reminding people of what you did. Second, apologies rarely satisfy people. They almost always seem inadequate. That&#x2019;s because apologies are &#x201C;self-belittling&#x201D;&#x2014;they shrink you down to the size of the victim. People often demand an apology more as vengeance than as a way to improve matters. Instead, you need to be in a position of strength so that you can solve the problem and get past the screw up.Heinrichs is the author of&#xA0;<em>Thank You for Arguing&#xA0;</em>and&#xA0;<em>Word Hero&#xA0;</em>and you can follow him on&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.jayheinrichs.com\" target=\"_blank\">jayheinrichs.com</a>.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Since the inception of advertising, the goal of a brand has always been <strong>&#x201C;How can I get my message in front of consumers who are most likely to be influenced?</strong>&#x201D; Over the decades, media such as newspapers, radio, and television have made increasing strides to bring in a well-defined audience to a place where an advertiser can effectively reach them.&#xA0;But despite the successes, this has remained a game of statistics, general summaries, and aggregation.Social media sites&#x2014;exemplified by Facebook&#x2014;have changed this equation dramatically by bringing concrete data about single individuals into the mix. Now a brand can go beyond targeting people based on a strategic set of numbers and demographics, to a broad group that includes interests, thoughts, and what they&#x2019;ve recently searched for online. These networks give the user ample opportunities to reveal personal information about their likes and dislikes, who they follow, who they communicate with, the games they play, the music they listen to, and a large subset of their online activity. This data can be used to predict purchase behavior, determine influencers, and many other pieces of information that make a marketer&#x2019;s job easier.However, this comes at the cost of the consumer&#x2019;s privacy&#x2014;a high cost, which is only beginning come to light. The inevitable backlash is coming. First amongst a small group of privacy crusaders, followed by a large percentage of the internet-using population, landing inevitably in litigation.<strong>Who do you trust?</strong><strong><span>&#xA0;</span></strong>The issue at hand is that there is a fundamental breach of trust at the heart of the way in which traditional networks like Facebook and Google+ operate.&#xA0;As a person, every day I make trust-decisions with people and entities that I interact with. When I use my credit card, I am trusting my bank to know what I buy. When I read a book on my Kindle, I am trusting Amazon to know what I read.&#xA0;When I go to my doctor, I am trusting the healthcare system to know what ailments I have and what medicines I am receiving. We make these trust decisions because we understand how these entities work, and we know that they are responsible (and in some cases liable) for maintaining our trust. These entities are also compartmentalized&#x2014;Amazon doesn&#x2019;t know what medicines I&#x2019;m taking and my doctor doesn&#x2019;t know what I&#x2019;m reading.But when I connect those same transactions with a social network, the trust lines are no longer valid. Not only do I end up sharing data that I may have thought was private with Facebook, but Facebook is not bound by the same trust relationship that I have with the original party. Suddenly Facebook knows both my medical history and my reading history, and I may have never intended for those two to come together. What&#x2019;s more, Facebook will then sell that information to parties I have never met, much less decided are trustworthy. It seems like a valuable product for advertisers&#x2014;a car salesman, for example, might want to know that a person is a Microsoft executive, a Republican, makes over $160k/year and has a car that is five-years old. But that person himself might never have wanted their employment data and political affiliation correlated. Most people only accept this now because they don&#x2019;t realize it&#x2019;s happening. Once people become aware, I expect consumers and government to stop it.<strong>The issue at hand is that mainstream social networks are breaking the underlying trust relationships that we believe exists.</strong>Where will that leave brands who want to do targeted messaging? Does this mean we have to go back to vague targeting, aggregations and statistical likelihoods and give up our concrete data?&#xA0;Luckily no. The issue is not the targeting itself,&#xA0;it&#x2019;s the breaking of the underlying trust relationships by the current mainstream social networks.As a consumer, I appreciate well-targeted advertising. When I am in the market for a camera, a car or even a new show, I welcome suggestions that are relevant to me and that can help inform my opinion, inspire me, educate me, or even incentivize me with a deal. My concern comes from how this information is collected.The trick will be in devising a way for the original information holders that you trust&#x2014;be it your bank, your doctor, or an online retailer&#x2014;to share relevant and verified facts on your behalf without revealing the information behind those facts. For example, if I am writing a review of a hotel, I may want to claim that I am a person who frequently stays at 5 star hotels so you know that my review is credible.&#xA0;A travel company that I already trust with my travel history could issue a statement on my behalf that says I stay at many five star hotels without releasing my actual travel history. Or that company could issue me a statement that says I work at a tech company without releasing my actual email address or even my company name.<strong>How badges work</strong>Statements of information from one company to another&#x2014;referred to as <a href=\"http://www.techlearning.com/features/0039/theres-a-badge-for-that/54727\">badges</a>&#x2014;can be beneficial for a person when they are needed.&#xA0;So I might use my travel badge in a travel review site and my tech badge in a tech review site. The badges themselves do not contain any of the personal identifying information&#x2014;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information\">PII</a>&#x2014;that was used to generate it, so there is no breakdown in the trust barrier. And because the use of the badges is decided by the consumer at the time of an interaction, we can have confidence that the consumer is comfortable sharing that verified fact about himself. That is to say, if I post a statement with a tech worker badge attached, I would not be adverse to seeing an ad that is targeting tech workers. Or if I posted with a stays-in-five-star-hotels badge, I would not be surprised to see high-end hotels ads targeting me. What I do have a problem with is when I am talking on a travel site and I see ads that are targeting me for being a tech employee. The lack of PII in badges makes that type of privacy impossible.Badging also solves one of the most egregious PII sharing issues on social networks&#x2014; the insistence on &#x201C;real names&#x201D;. Because these networks are based on aggregation, they need something to hang all of the aggregation around. Any reputation a user has in these networks is based on sharing some subset of the data they have collected about the user. Because this boundary is fluid, these systems are increasingly plagued by data leaking between scenarios in ways that a user never intended, such as when a school teacher is fired for some activity that they did in their own time but made it onto their Facebook feed.Badging enables a user to share just the parts of his identity that are relevant at the time. For a hotel review, it is not relevant that I am a tech worker or that I am Dave Vronay. All that matters is that I often stay at 5-star hotels. Badges give people an easy way to use just the subset of their verified identity that is relevant for the task at hand, while also letting advertisers know how a person wants to be approached.<strong>The solution to enhance consumer privacy is Badge Authority</strong>Badge Authority is a secure intermediary that sits between badge issuers (those who have information) and badge consumers (those who want to use badges). Email domain based badges are currently in use on the <a href=\"http://goheard.com\" target=\"_blank\">Heard social exchange</a>, and we expect them to become increasingly popular across the internet as PII issues become a mainstream concern.

Consumers&#x2019; appetites are changing, and forward-thinking retail brands are creating instore experiences to adapt to those changes and satisfy those appetites, creating key differentiation for themselves in the process.<em>&#x201C;Experience is the new marketing currency, with the customer experience poised to be the main competitive differentiator. It&#x2019;s time for organizations to turn their attention to return on experience.&#x201D; - The Wall Street Journal</em><a href=\"https://www.adventureclubs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Adventure Design Studio</a> (ADS) specializes in designing brand-focused family experiences. The studio is using the power of design to create unique experiences families with kids love. Young parents crave unique experiences to share with their children. To get this right takes a deep understanding of market analysis and comprehension of what motivates and drives parents to purchase experiences. ADS believes that by strengthening families through shared experiences they can build stronger families and stronger communities.Adventure Design Studio is a team of experience designers and child development experts that create family-focused experiences for brands.We had the opportunity to talk to Janelle Schroy, co-founder of Adventure Design Studio and the Adventure Clubs mobile app and author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Childhood-Great-Experiences-Share-ebook/dp/B07G9QVHZQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1550621029&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Designing+Childhood%3A+50+Great+Experiences+to+Share+with+your+Child\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Designing Childhood: 50 Great Experiences to Share with your Child</em></a>, to learn more about this opportunity for brands and how it can help grow a customer base, social media engagements and a bottom line. Janelle shared a few stories of the brands they&#x2019;ve worked with and the results they&#x2019;ve achieved.&#x201C;Shopping is no longer a battle of price and convenience. It&#x2019;s a race to create something customers can touch and feel.&#x201D;- Janelle Schroy<strong>Building an Individual Experience with Pottery Barn Kids</strong>The Pottery Barn Kids store is so beautiful, casual and comfortable that kids might feel they are in a dream home, then immediately want the same style in their own house. ADS worked to create a unique individual experience. The idea was to provide kids the opportunity to play the role of an interior designer while their parents shop. Children receive a stand-up design board, a PBK magazine, scissors and glue. They are invited to explore the store in search of trending colors, styles and themes. Once they decide on their dream style, they can go wild arranging their dream house on their design board using cutouts from their PBK magazine. When finished, they are encouraged to share them with store designers and post them on social media using the company&#x2019;s hashtags and social media handles.&#x201C;When customers identify with a brand emotionally, they&#x2019;re more willing to purchase, even when the brand isn&#x2019;t the least expensive or most convenient.&#x201D;- Janelle Schroy<strong>Designing an Inclusive Group Experience with the San Diego City Ballet</strong>ADS works both with the San Diego City Ballet and ballet companies in other cities to inspire a new generation of dancers by inviting them to be part of unique experiences with the company dancers. The experiences are designed to inspire budding dancers by taking them backstage for their ballet company rehearsal, where a small group of families get extra special treatment. Kids meet famous ballet dancers and explore what it takes to put together a full production&#x2014;the rehearsals, the lighting and staging, the costuming, and the final show. They learn that although ballerinas make their art look effortless, being a star also takes hard work and dedication. Families are sometimes invited to join the dancers in the studio for a mini ballet class with a leading ballerina. Other times, children are each given an autographed pointe shoe that has been worn by a real ballerina onstage. This experience creates lifelong fans, picturesque moments and a reason for families to share their experience with others, both in person and on social media.<strong>Creating a Precious In-Store Experience with Tiffany &amp; Co.<br><br></strong>ADS worked with the team at Tiffany&#x2019;s to design a group experience that educated, inspired and made each individual feel special. This group adventure invites families to share an actual breakfast at Tiffany&#x2019;s, just like Audrey Hepburn. The group is given a specialized introduction to this world-famous brand. A diamond expert guides the group in learning the basics of precious stones&#x2014;their cuts, colors, clarity and shapes, even origin and formation. They uncover not only knowledge about diamonds, but also invaluable life lessons for children&#x2014;finding the preciousness in every human being, each one unique and priceless, made more beautiful through difficulties. Kids are invited to touch, feel and even try on some the diamonds. This rich memorable experience connects families to the Tiffany&#x2019;s brand in a very meaningful way.<strong>More About Adventure Design Studio<br><br></strong>Offering family-focused experiences can grow your customer base, your social media engagements and your bottom line.

This deep thinker of seventeen years uses his curiosity like a microscope and language like a poet. Tim is an unusually fascinating lad who could have been a fitting character at the start of the Renaissance, and as he started to think about what he wants to do with his life, he admitted a deep sense of apprehension and anxiety fueled by his belief that there isn&#x2019;t a place for him in this great country of ours. His struggle is deeply routed in how society paints a picture of what success looks like, and that lovingly crafting and making hand-made guitars and violins has no place in the definition of success. My recommendation to Tim was to take a step back and explore the artisan movement to help him ease the tension&#x2014;to explore what is currently being hand-made. I asked him to jot down his findings as he explored. Here is what he had to say. I hope you enjoy his point of view and his style as much as I did.<br><br><strong>DREAMING OF MAKING SOMETHING OUT OF MY LIFE</strong><br><br>Craftsmanship is not just an occupation or hobby, it is a way of life, a different way of life. The craftsman is someone who, unlike many of today&#x2019;s financially focused white-collar workers, does what he absolutely loves for a living. He is an artist, one who takes pride in his finished work while others find enjoyment from the utility of their work. The craftsman&#x2019;s honor comes from the honest integrity of creating products of value and joy.<br><br>I have firsthand experience of the fulfillment and peace that comes from the art of craft. I am an amateur luthier (builder of stringed instruments) with two years of high school woodshop under my belt, and I am well into the making of my first guitar from scratch. It was not only the fresh morning air or the musty smell of old hand tools and sawdust that got me hooked, but it was watching a piece of solid mahogany being lovingly transformed into something that would soon resonate beautiful music, shaped by my hands.<br><br>The genuine passion for making things seems to be a lost art in the US. As we&#x2019;ve reached the age of mass-manufacturing and production, we&#x2019;ve compromised quality for its ugly sister&#x2014;quantity. We transferred all of our production from the shop to the factory, which has increased efficiency and output hundreds of times over, but also accustomed us to cheaper merchandise, which while very cost-effective, lacks in quality and long-term value. If that wasn&#x2019;t enough, we then abdicated our responsibility for making things in this country and transferred the majority of manufacturing to our brothers in China all in the name of cost.<br><br>My theory is that the factory in China is not a healthy environment for change and evolution in a product, but rather a crack house of addiction to cheap and cheerful goods that hold no long-term value.&#xA0; Whereas, the craftsman&#x2019;s workshop is a Petri dish for improvement and a haven for quality. When an item is made on an assembly line or by machines, it is made according to a strict set of standards; the goal being to produce as many items as the factory possibly can (within reason and budget), all exactly the same&#x2014;deviations lead to recalls.<br><br>This cookie cutter mentality is not present in the workshop. The product is at the whim of the artisan&#x2019;s imagination, where it is under constant scrutiny and subject to frequent revisions. In this environment there is personal touch and care given to each item made, and a sense of created value between the craftsman and the consumer. So while there was an exodus of manufacturing to China, and the sucking sound of jobs leaving these lands, there seems to be a resurgence across many industries to go back to the workshop, back to the craftsman and the art of lovingly crafting each item one at a time, and appreciating the journey to get there. One such industry is the surfboard industry.<br><br>Before 2005,<a href=\"http://www.clarkfoam.net/\" target=\"_blank\"> Clark Foam</a> was the world&#x2019;s leader in surfboard blank production, producing the foam cores for an estimated 80% of all domestic surfboard shapers. When they ceased production in late 2005, the popularity of cheap imported Asian sweatshop-made boards increased. But with this pre-recession detente the surfboard industry welcomed a new age of innovative shaping techniques and craftsmanship.<br><br>Surfboard producers adjusted to a market dominated by imported products by reinventing the surfboard itself with new materials, new methods, and new up-and-coming shapers introducing their own twist on the stick. Today, there is more variety than ever in the market and new shapers are springing up all over the map.<br><br>While this is not the case for many industries such as the computer industry, where there are many intricate parts requiring precise machinery and engineering, industries like surfboards, guitars, beer, food, furniture, clothing, jewelry, and shoes all have one thing in common: these high quality items are usually made by hand, by private artisans and craftsmen. Take guitars, for example: even to the untrained eye, there is a noticeable difference between a factory-machined guitar and one built by a luthier, and it&#x2019;s not just price. Everything is affected&#x2014;timbre, selection of wood, quality of parts, reliability&#x2014;which sets it apart as a one-of-a-kind piece of work. For me, this fascination with making things was born from the feeling of appreciation and reverence derived from holding a handmade guitar that reeled me into lutherie. As I enter college I wonder if we will start making more of what we consume, and make it with the pride of craftsmanship.<br><br>In today&#x2019;s economy is there a place for a craftsman, and what about tomorrow? We&#x2019;ve already seen a paradigm shift from factory-made to handmade in the surfboard industry, and it&#x2019;s in the works in other industries. Perhaps we&#x2019;re going through a renaissance of consumer habits, bringing back the art and appreciation of quality, vintage and reviving the honor and joy of true craft. There&#x2019;s a growing market for handcrafted items, and I&#x2019;m hopeful that the future will hold a host of opportunities for someone like me who wants to take their hobby or passion beyond a leisurely activity.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"<strong>An interview with Patrick Dodd</strong><em>Music is a powerful force and an important part of our culture today. It tantalizes the senses and evokes emotion, movement and soul. Music can make us think, influence passion, and spark creativity. Music brings people together.&#xA0;</em><em>We recently had the opportunity to sit with Patrick Dodd, music video producer and general music enthusiast, to talk about how music is shaping his life.</em><strong>Where does your passion for music come from?<br></strong>Passion for music is in my blood. My whole life, my family has passionately engineered and encouraged music&#x2014;children were expected to have a musical piece to share at extended family gatherings, we all took lessons and were always ready to share. I loved to play and perform and recall wanting to spend every waking moment playing my guitar.&#xA0;In the summer of 1999, a few friends invited me to a garage-sized venue in Pacific Beach, California called The Melting Pot. Over that summer we watched a number of bands playing music and having a great time (<a href=\"http://www.switchfoot.com\" target=\"_blank\">Switchfoot</a> seemed to have an exceptionally good time). I knew from that summer that music&#x2014;in some way&#x2014;was going to be a part of my future.<strong>Who inspires the music you write?<br></strong>Musically, there are so many influences and it&#x2019;s constantly evolving. The artists who stay true to who they are over a period of time have had major impact on me. Going back through <a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/83087-Ryan-Adams\" target=\"_blank\">Ryan Adams&#x2019; discography</a> recently has been really fun for that reason. The tone of his voice evokes such great emotion and the progression of songwriting really reflects the journey he&#x2019;s on.&#xA0;Historically, my music specifically would be linked to people like <a href=\"http://johnmayer.com\" target=\"_blank\">John Mayer</a>. I remember hearing <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/John+Mayer/Room+for+Squares\" target=\"_blank\">Room For Squares</a> for the first time&#xA0;and thinking, <em>&#x201C;this is amazing</em>!&#x201D;(Listen to one of Patrick&#x2019;s songs, &#x201C;Together,&#x201D; below.)<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/125169658&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>&#xA0;<strong>Tell us about SerialBox Presents.<br></strong><a href=\"http://d.pr/Q1UK\" target=\"_blank\">SerialBox Presents</a> is a one take, multi-cam, multi-track performance project <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanbooth\" target=\"_blank\">my friend Ryan</a> originally started as a hobby. From <a href=\"http://d.pr/tmb1\" target=\"_blank\">the first session I saw</a>, it instantly became one of my favorite musical projects. A few years ago we discussed the series progress, and although the project was a success, the management side of things was not his forte. I encouraged him to keep moving forward because the project fulfilled a niche in the industry and inspired many. A week later Ryan called asking if I would be willing to be the Executive Producer of the series, and here we are today. We&#x2019;re moving forward with the goal of injecting beauty back into the world. We work with amazing artists and feel honored to capture some very special moments.<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/13814374\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/13814374\">SerialBox Presents: PAPER ROUTE - &quot;Are We All Forgotten&quot;</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/serialbox\">SerialBox Presents</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.<strong>What&#x2019;s next for SerialBox?<br></strong>Right now, we&#x2019;re working toward transitioning what we do into TV format, and just launched a <a title=\"SerialBoxTV Kickstarter\" href=\"http://d.pr/tW9w\" target=\"_blank\">Kickstarter campaign</a> to enable us to work on the SerialBoxTV Pilot featuring Noah Gundersen. You can get a taste of what we&#x2019;re trying to do here:<strong>What&#x2019;s the most interesting thing about the music industry?<br></strong>Music as a whole is always in a state of transition&#x2013;&#x2013;recuperating from the fear of digital sharing and streaming services to a state that is beginning to embrace musicians and inspire a new approach to the industry. Streaming services are forcing artists to think differently and find other ways to make a living through their art. It&#x2019;s really interesting to see some of the byproducts of the shift.Also, technology&#x2013;&#x2013;music production isn&#x2019;t what it once was. I&#x2019;m a bit too young to remember the days of recording to tape, but I go to <a href=\"http://www.namm.org\">NAMM</a> every year, and the amount of technology being released for musicians is insane. <em>Everything</em> is being optimized for a better instrumental experience.&#xA0;Music trends are also really interesting to me&#x2014;most recently the increase in vinyl purchases. Considering the high quality sound and audio tracks we&#x2019;re able to download online, to have the consumer continue buying such lo-fi music is refreshing. I personally love vinyls, they are one of the purest forms of an artist&#x2019;s finished product.<strong>What&#x2019;s the best advice you&#x2019;ve ever been given?<br></strong>For me, life has been a constant string of good advice from a lot of wise people. I&#x2019;ve been fortunate to be surrounded by great mentors that have taken me under their wings and shown me first-hand many valuable principles like compassion, humility, determination, and perseverance.&#xA0;One piece of advice I often think of is actually from&#xA0;Conan&#x2019;s last night on NBC&#x2019;s Tonight Show&#xA0;when he said,&#xA0;&#x201C;Nobody in life gets exactly what they thought they were going to get. But if you work really hard and you&#x2019;re kind, amazing things will happen.&#x201D;<strong>There&#x2019;s so much music out there, how/where do you find new artists?<br></strong><a href=\"http://spotify.extole.com/v2/share/5950703215040093593\">Spotify</a> is a great tool for artist discovery<em>. </em>It gives people the ability to instantly listen to&#xA0;anything&#xA0;they want, and their recommendation engine is constantly improving. On the flip side, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ramirezdavid/\">my friend David</a> said it best when he said, &#x201C;Spotify doesn&#x2019;t steal from artists as much as it steals from the listener.&#x201D; The listener today has so too many options resulting in a digressed value in music. I&#x2019;m fortunate to be exposed to a variety of artists, however I still find that some of the best music discoveries are those that are personally recommended to be by trusted friends. That&#x2019;s one of the upsides of Spotify, friends creating and sharing playlists. It makes sharing and the discovery process so much fun.<strong>How does music influence your daily life?<br></strong>That&#x2019;s hard to pin down. But, if I had to answer that:<br>1. It&#x2019;s one of the first things that sets the tone for my day<br>2. Different music gets me in the zone for different needs&#x2013;&#x2013;work, exercise, thinking, reading<br>3. When I look back at life, so many of my greatest friends and experiences came about from music<br>4. I hear melodies everywhere<strong>If you could have dinner with any musician, dead or alive, who would it be and why?<br></strong>Oh man, there are several. <a href=\"http://johnmayer.com\">John Mayer</a>, <a href=\"http://www.atu2.com/band/bono/\">Bono</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theeraser.net/Stage1UK/\">Thom Yorke</a> would be up there.&#xA0;I would ask how songwriting has manifested itself for them and why they do what they do, and they would all have interesting insights into a book I&#x2018;m in the early research phase for. I think artists can often underestimate their art and its emotional value when they get beat down by the critics and the business side of it.<strong>What&#x2019;s your favorite album right now?&#xA0;<br></strong>Always a hard question, but I have been listening to <a href=\"http://asgeirmusic.com/\">Asgeir</a> for a few years now and I can&#x2019;t get enough. And the newest <a href=\"http://www.thewarondrugs.net\">War on Drugs</a> record is so good. The sounds on both of those records are pushing the envelope &#x2026; it&#x2019;s inspiring.<strong>What advice would you give someone who wants to pursue a career in the music industry?<br></strong>Work hard, be kind, and roll with the punches. Don&#x2019;t give up.<strong>What are your Uncommon Sense Steps to doing what you love?<br></strong>-&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Identify your influences, and then figure out your own style<br>-&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Write all possible inspiration down<br>-&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Don&#x2019;t be afraid to invest in taking risks, it can bring huge returns<em>&#xA0;</em><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Letting your guard down basically boils down to one thing&#x2026; being appropriately vulnerable in your communication, which in turn promotes a culture of trust. This diagram is a simply visual showing a different way to achieve effective management and stronger leadership.Ironically, most leaders choose not to share aspects of their lives that translate into humanizing themselves. As a result, they miss the opportunity to build relationships which leads to higher engagement and productivity. Simply put, people work much harder for leaders they like, know and trust. Patrick Lencioni answers the question of &#x201C;Why is it so difficult for leaders to be vulnerable?&#x201D; in his bestselling book <em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable.</span></em> He says, &#x201C;Achieving&#xA0;vulnerability-based trust is difficult because in the course of career-advancement and education, most successful people learn to be competitive with their peers, and protective of their reputations. It is a challenge for them to turn those instincts off for the good of a team, but that is exactly what is required.&#x201D;The three bottom-line outcomes resulting from communicating in an appropriately vulnerable way are:Trust is the bedrock for getting things done. Jack Welch says that <em>people will not do their best without it</em>. And, management guru, Warren Bennis, calls it <em>the major leadership challenge of today and tomorrow</em>. &#xA0;People are curious about their leader&#x2019;s lives. Unless people know who you are and what makes you tick, they will not fully trust you. They also want their leaders to be interested in them, so ask questions to discover who they are as well. Write down what you learn so you can meaningfully relate something of importance to them in future interactions.Here are four easy ways to be appropriately vulnerable, inviting people to get to know you thus building stronger relationships:When people trust you, they will perceive you as having integrity, being reliable, fair, caring, open, competent and loyal.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"I used to be a good little boy. I followed the plan for life. I studied relatively hard and got good qualifications. I battled with the good and the great to get the best jobs that were offered to graduates and I won a cracking placement.So far the plan for life was rolling out beautifully and I was all set to be a winner.I then played some pretty cool hands at the card table of career and got myself running one of the biggest and best brands in the country, Carling Black Label. We had huge budgets, huge profits and won brand of the year. I was on a roll and should have been absolutely delighted.The problem was that I wasn&#x2019;t.I had this nagging doubt deep inside of me that this was not my life.Much as I enjoyed the fun of marketing, making ads and the cut and thrust of business; there was something missing.Logically, I was tortured. I did everything I was supposed to do. I was successful. My future was looking incredibly shiny. When I spoke to my friends and family about the itch that I was feeling, they thought I was mad.I got nice cars, a generous package, as much beer as I could carry to any social gathering, lunches in great restaurants, the best agencies in the land working on my account; so why wasn&#x2019;t I happy?I almost felt ungrateful to even doubt that this wasn&#x2019;t the career for me.Unfortunately, my master plan for life was unraveling and I had no idea as to why. I decided it was just a phase. Everything on paper looked peachy keen and therefore I just needed to ride it out.I put my head down and ploughed on and yet the itch inside me continued to develop. I was shaken, unsettled and totally confused. <a href=\"https://minutehack.com/opinions/we-all-should-be-trusting-our-intuition-a-whole-lot-more\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rationale and logic</a> was not serving me and yet it had been my trusted friends forever. I was properly lost.After months of feeling like I was losing the plot, I finally listened.One night after work I sat quietly and instead of ignoring the itch and squashing it with distractions, I let the feeling wash over me and asked the itch exactly what it was saying. At first I wasn&#x2019;t sure what to listen to let alone what the message was. Then, out of nowhere it all fell into place. A sense of knowing crystallised within me. I went from confusion to clarity.It was obvious that I had to create space to find out what my next chapter would be. I needed to resign, get on a plane and go for an adventure with enough time to try on some new potential futures.It was fine not to have the answer; in fact, the beauty of being clear that my next step was just about creating space and experiences was palpable. It felt so right.That was one of the pivotal moments in my life where everything changed for the better.Not listening to my inner voice was incredibly destabilising. It felt as if there was a pressure growing inside of me that eventually had to burst. As soon as I listened, the pressure subsided and I got back into a state of flow.All too often we get trapped by thinking we should know the answer and that we should do what society expects of us. Many people are miserable as a result. <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/sir_ken_robinson_bring_on_the_revolution/transcript?language=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Living a life that doesn&#x2019;t quite fit</a> is a lot like wearing the wrong size shoes.I have <a href=\"https://www.uppingyourelvis.com/post/how-to-access-the-power-of-your-subconscious-easily-every-day\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">learnt to listen</a> much more frequently and every time I do, I am grateful. I don&#x2019;t always have the answers but sometimes just being clear that I have a question is enough.If you listen deeply to yourself, you may find that everything clicks into place and becomes so much easier.Life is not linear. And yes, life is short but it&#x2019;s also long and complicated.Give yourself a break and tune in to that voice and who knows what you may hear?&#xA0;<em>Read more from <a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/author/chris-barz-brown#filters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chris</a>.</em><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Happiness comes from many different sources, but the one characteristic that happy people share is that they are different. They are different because they have found a way to be true to themselves.<strong><em>Why is it so hard to step out of the shadows and express ourselves uniquely?</em></strong>Coupled with the fact that there is no social incentive to behave differently, it&#x2019;s easier to deal with what we already know. The lack of incentive starts at school, trickles to our neighborhoods, our organizations and is weaved into our society. As a result, uniqueness diminishes and the risk of replicating other people&apos;s acts or expectations increases.<strong>What applies to human beings is also true for companies and brands.&#xA0;<br> </strong>We may think that copying can be a winning strategy. Samsung is the perfect example of a huge success, copycat strategy. But this type of success never lasts long. Soon someone like Huawei will pop up and do it better, faster and cheaper. In a globalized world, if we don&#x2019;t force ourselves to step out, inevitably a better imitation will appear.It&#x2019;s much more difficult to do something that nobody has done before. Oftentimes companies rely on new technologies to enhance innovations and experiences. This can be a solution, but it&apos;s very rare to distinguish yourself with technology alone. Technology is indispensible, but more and more accessible and easier to catch up with.&#xA0;<strong>Step out of the shadows and to be true to you. </strong>Innovate by listening. Determine what makes you uniquely valuable. Have the courage to express your unique characteristics. Invite judgement and feedback by others. Learn from failures and persist, despite what your critics may say. Stay the course until the journey becomes a success.&#xA0;Our DNA, our personal histories and our experiences shape us uniquely.<strong>Adopt a true to you strategy </strong>The French fashion brand <a href=\"http://www.agnesb.us/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Agnes B</strong></a> was founded by Agnes Troubl&#xE9;, one of Frances richest women. A freelance stylist with no fashion education, she created her own brand in the early 1970&#x2019;s. Starting from scratch, she has built and maintained her empire, and still holds 100% of the company. She now has 272 boutiques all over the world in cities like New York, London, Dubai, Beijing, Shanghai and Tokyo.Agnes B decided to create fashion she fancies, not allowing outside trends to dictate her choices. Her clothes reflect her own timeless style&#x2013;a blend of non-bourgeois elegance and rock&#x2019;n roll attitude. Quentin Tarantino chose her fashion designs for his Reservoir Dogs characters. In a heavily disrupted industry, Agnes B has resisted globalization and the commoditization coming from low-cost design brands such as H&amp;M and Zara, and the industry consolidation where so many fashion brands end up as subsidaries of worldwide groups like LVMH or Kering.Now in her fifth business decade, Agnes B remains independent and edgy. She is an icon for young artists such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDXOzr0GoA4\" target=\"_blank\">Jain</a>, the singer who always wears her dresses. Agnes B has rejected trends and copycat strategies, setting the stage to be original and unique. Her legacy teaches us that if you want to build a lasting business that no one can copy, you have to build the only monopoly that no one will ever be able to replicate&#x2013;the monopoly of you.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"A culture defines the normal way people behave in a particular group. It provides the cues, boundaries, guidelines and encouragement that help individual members of a group know what&#x2019;s right and what&#x2019;s wrong. Culture guides decisions that result in actions. The best way to understand a culture is to pay attention to actual behavior and evidence created by the people of that particular group. It&#x2019;s also great to compare groups to discover similarities and differences in their cultures, which is what the field of Anthropology is all about.In the context of a company, I often hear people say things like, &#x201C;We have a winning culture here,&#x201D; or &#x201C;We&#x2019;re building a culture of innovation,&#x201D; or &#x201C;Our culture is defined by our values&#x201D;. These could all be true statements, but they are not useful as descriptions of their particular cultures.To describe a culture, specific traits need to be identified (or &#x201C;ways&#x201D; that people interact) and evidence needs to be found proving that these &#x201C;ways&#x201D; are useful &#x2013; or at least believed to be useful by the members of that particular group. If a company has a culture of innovation, what characteristics about their behavior demonstrate innovativeness and what artifacts of that behavior are cherished and celebrated as the outcomes of that behavior?I&#x2019;ve had the great privilege of working in some of the world&#x2019;s most innovative companies (as defined by <em>Fast Company</em> magazine) including IDEO, Charles Schwab, Levi Strauss, and Hulu. Leaders at each company believe their cultures are a significant reason for their success. Having been a part of each of them, I can say that they are each distinctly different from the others. So while they may all have &#x201C;winning&#x201D; or &#x201C;innovative&#x201D; cultures, there is no common culture across them. Behaving one way at Levi Strauss could actually get you fired at Hulu and vice-versa.To understand what is innovative at IDEO, you just have to listen to the stories they tell each other about great moments in the company&#x2019;s history. In fact, so many people ask IDEO about their culture, nearly any person who works there can point to examples of their innovative behavior that resulted in breakthrough product designs like the first Apple mouse or the Crest Neat Squeeze toothpaste tube.What every leader should know about culture is that it has to be defined, built and actively managed if you want it to help your business succeed. In most cases, culture should be defined <em>in response</em> to a business problem, not in advance of one. I don&#x2019;t believe there&#x2019;s such a thing as &#x201C;the best&#x201D; culture that could be built first and then applied to any business problem. So just like a supply chain for making shoes would be different than a supply chain for making cars, each culture should be constructed to address the unique challenges of the business at hand.Culture should not necessarily be a reflection of the founder, CEO or executive team&#x2014;although leaders must behave in accordance with the culture or it is unlikely that others will follow. Lip service to a value like customer service followed by actions that don&#x2019;t treat customers well will not build a customer-centered culture. All of the advertising dollars in the world and videos of the CEO pronouncing that he personally cares for every customer who flies with them will not make airline customers feel treated with respect if they are dumped from flights for unexplained reasons.

The workplace is a product of the space itself, but also of the people who are there.There are no bad ideas in our office. We brainstorm across departments, and as sub-departments. Our interns join the meetings and although some might take time to sit back and observe, others are ready to contribute on the first day. I am proud to say that we never had to tell an intern that ideas are welcome&#x2014;they could feel it. How do you create this atmosphere? I believe it comes from the top down. If you&#x2019;re a CEO and you believe your ideas are good, and that more ideas are even better, you don&#x2019;t feel threatened by those under you or feel the need to shut down others&#x2019; ideas because &#x201C;we tried something like that once and it didn&#x2019;t work.&#x201D; That willingness to engage, however briefly, with even the worst ideas will change your culture in the best possible way.For those of us in creative fields, the tools we use day-to-day can make or break a job. I&#x2019;ve come close to tears when my brain was moving faster than my browser. Whether it&#x2019;s a laptop or a program you need, or a desk at the proper height and Wi-Fi at a reasonable speed&#x2014;these simple things allow us to do work that we desire to do really well. You&#x2019;d think more offices would invest in top-quality hardware to enable the best work from employees&#x2014;and I imagine the companies that attract top talent do.When startups are competing for engineers, the perks offered can get out of hand&#x2014;free meals, a car service to get home, expensive gym memberships or in-house yoga classes&#x2014;but none of these compare to offering a new hire a generous budget to buy themselves a workstation. An ideal workstation for the individual should be required while everything else&#x2014;the art on the walls, the selection of snacks in the kitchen, the coffee brew on hand&#x2014;is icing on the cake.Of course, there should be space to <em>not</em> work as well, because sometimes a new perspective can come from sitting on a couch rather than in a chair. At <a href=\"http://mashable.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Mashable</em></a> we have an entire room designed for celebrations and spending time away from your desk. When I worked for a startup, we&#x2019;d often ditch the office in the middle of the day and go work out of a coffee shop around the corner. At other jobs I felt chained to my desk for eight hours a day. My food budget was through the roof because I&#x2019;d eat lunch out just to make sure I spent a reasonable amount of time out of the office each day. Did those other bosses know the difference? Of course not, but I know how monotony and an uncomfortable chair can kill hours of productivity each week. And so many of us endure our situation, saying nothing to avoid sounding like a 20something diva, until finally getting a better job in a intentionally designed workspace&#x2014;and realize we knew better all along.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

My own wisdom and that of all about me seemed insufficient for that day.&#x201D; -</em>Abraham LincolnOur openness to the possibility that we do not know it all&#x2014;to challenge and question ourselves&#x2014;might be the first step to getting over ourselves. Most of the situations we face are not anticipated. Our immediate response to the challenges we encounter is to do what has worked before. However, we may find ourselves addressing problems that are not rote models, requiring us to venture into unchartered territory and adapt to uncertainty. What to do as leaders in our jobs when faced with these types of decisions can be daunting. &#xA0;Edgar Schein, professor emeritus at MIT Sloan School of Management and an&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Humble-Inquiry-Gentle-Instead-Telling/dp/1609949811\">expert on leadership and culture</a>, states one of the attributes that defines great executives is humility. In an increasingly complex world, humility is a necessary quality for leadership, as it allows us to create space to receive the input of others and develop and learn. Humility also enriches our lives and the lives of those around us, making us mindful of our own limitations. It&#x2019;s an indispensable ingredient to living an abundant life and an essential virtue that forces one to live counter to acceptable norms, requiring a daily decision to let go of one&#x2019;s ego.&#xA0;&#xA0;When thinking about leadership, humility does not usually come to mind for most of us, but various studies have shown that it is a vital characteristic to achieving success as a leader. It&#x2019;s OK to share mistakes in order to let others know that we do not have all the answers, to be transparent in the corporate setting and to engage workgroups for the professional and personal growth of everyone involved. Humility nudges us to be inclusive&#x2014;to be open to varied perspectives which leads to the empowerment of others and ultimately demonstrates courage, ability and confidence.Humility is often unduly dismissed as a necessary quality for leaders simply because it is misunderstood. Humility is &#x201C;strength in weakness&#x201D;&#x2014;it&#x2019;s admitting our own weaknesses and strengths while also acknowledging the virtues and shortcomings of others. It positions us for out-of-the-box reasoning, a corporate rather than individual mindset and a purposeful focus on the larger objective.&#xA0;<strong>Leaders go beyond the call of duty&#x2014;they attend to others&#x2019; needs</strong>.&#xA0; &#xA0;A few years ago, I boarded a plane headed for Haiti with twelve very successful medical practitioners. It was following an earthquake that devastated the island, and for these men and women it meant leaving the comfort of their homes in the U.S. to provide care for a people they knew nothing about and who afterward they may never see again. While in Haiti, they worked tirelessly from dawn to dusk seeing the many injured and comforting the young and old alike. Their compassion, care and professional approach to each case was exemplary. One team member went beyond the call of duty to address the emotional trauma facing her patients. She spent countless hours sitting on dirt floors with sick children to not only address their physical needs but also address their emotional needs, going so far as to share her own clothes with those in need around her. In an unforeseen way, her actions sparked a transformative change in all the rest of the team. What wasn&#x2019;t known at the time was that she had decided to put aside the pressures of her own personal upheaval to care for a hurting people. She showed self-sacrifice demonstrated through authentic caring and fueled by a personal sense of duty, simply by placing the needs of others first.&#xA0; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_the_Apostle\">The Apostle Paul </a>writes in Philippians,&#xA0;<em>&#x201C;Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others&#x201D;.</em> I read recently that when one leads with humility, there is no job that is &#x201C;too small&#x201D;. &#xA0;&#xA0;<strong>Humble leaders maintain objectivity.</strong>Leaders who embrace humility are able to welcome the input of others and understand that decisions should be made in the best interest of the team or organization. People want their work to be valued, and they also value those who are not dismissive and embrace their positive contributions. The leader who is able to leave their ego at the door, accepts the individual strengths of their team members to work for the overall good or is able to exhibit trust that benefits the entire team, ensuring they&#x2019;ll be well respected. Any team member will be excitedly loyal and productive when they recognize and know that their leaders are not afraid to work arm in arm with them.This year let&#x2019;s consider ourselves less than we usually do and pay attention to the personal needs of others at work, at home and in our neighborhood. Let&#x2019;s not be distracted by the common expectations or tricked into believing that it is all about us.&#xA0; Leadership resolutions this year could include some self-reflection to enhance leadership perspective, help us learn from our actions and set the bar for our teams. Be a change agent. Lead by example. No matter how much we try to distance ourselves, we are still in need of each other. Our true measure is based on the number of lives we touch and not by the number of things we collect. And remember, &#x201C;<strong>Humility</strong> is the <strong>mother</strong> of all virtues&#x2026;&#x201D; &#x2014; Mother Teresa.&#xA0;<em>Read more from <a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/author/jos-pierre#filters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jose</a>.</em><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Like a surfer shifting angles to capture the energy of a wave, a business leader pivoting strategy is looking for new ways to keep rolling. The Financial Times defines a strategic pivot as &#x201C;the tortured path that most start-ups go through to find the right customer, value proposition, or positioning.&#x201D; The path is hard and hardly straight so tortured is a good word for it. A venture capitalist I talked with recently said, &#x201C;pivot is just another word for failure.&quot;I disagree. To me, a strategy pivot is the all-important step between failure and giving up. Another type of failure isn&#x2019;t as obvious and often engenders acceptance rather than action. The failure of mediocrity is that nothing changes. See my piece, <a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/how-to-fail-successfully\">How to Fail Successfully</a>, for a quick plan of action in that case.We&#x2019;ve all probably heard of successful pivots&#x2026;often without realizing that the pivot is the reason the companies lived on and why we&#x2019;ve heard of them. Here are just a few examples:A pivot isn&#x2019;t limited to early stage companies either. Look at IBM. The massive former computer maker is now a massive business services company. Remember when Amazon was just an online bookstore?<br>At its best, a strategy pivot is all about turning toward business opportunities that your company can be uniquely positioned to address. Martin Zwilling in Forbes outlined some common routes:It takes a certain amount of humility and self-awareness to recognize the need to pivot. It takes a fair bit of street savvy to do it well. Just like deciding initial strategy, a pivot should be based on data, experience, observation, and insight. Otherwise, the move might be just another distracting round of chasing the latest shiny new object.Here are some things to keep in mind as you look to catch that next &#x2013; and best &#x2013; wave&#x2026;<strong>Be problem focused rather than product focused.</strong> Stay in touch with the evolving needs of your target customer. Product focused companies act on a &#x201C;here&#x2019;s what we have to sell&#x201D; mentality. Problem focused businesses act with a &#x201C;here&#x2019;s what we have to solve&#x201D; mentality.&#xA0;<strong>Think broadly about the current and potential value you can bring to customer relationships.</strong> Consider product, technology, process, and service as currently offered and adjacencies that your customer may need. What problems or pain points are they facing that you aren&#x2019;t yet addressing? How can you reimagine your current offering and/or add to them in order to bring greater value to your customer? How can you do that in way that customers are willing to pay for?<strong>Understand the competitive situation that you&#x2019;re entering.</strong> How are those problems being solved now? What makes your approach unique? Why will your customers choose your solution?&#xA0;<strong>Define your vision for success and what it will take to get there.</strong> Be as specific as possible on both. Clarity improves execution.&#xA0;<strong>Test your way in, if possible.</strong> Can it be a trial run? The &#x201C;fail fast, fail cheap&#x201D; often translates into a sharper product or service offering and clearer path to near term success.&#xA0;<strong>Prioritize.</strong> Be specific about your plan, success requirements, and expectations. Then prioritize the work. What will be different: broadly across the business, operationally by group, and specifically for each person.&#xA0;?<strong>Align resources behind your new plan.</strong> Prioritization is empty without aligning resources behind your new plan. One easy check: if your new plan involves a shift in direction but no change in work &#x2013; as in, &#x201C;we&#x2019;re going to keep doing everything we&#x2019;re doing and also this new thing&#x201D; &#x2013; then you&#x2019;re probably not really prioritizing.&#xA0;<strong>Communicate all ways and always.</strong> Share why you&#x2019;re shifting direction, what needs to change, and how it affects individuals and groups across the business. Stay in touch and confirm understanding. Even more important, make sure to continually remove obstacles to the new direction.&#xA0;There&#x2019;s a time for staying the course and a time to shift. The above tactics can help ensure you&#x2019;re on top of the wave rather than getting crushed by it.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"All business is practical futurism, but not all futurism is practical for business. The former of these points should be self-evident. To do business successfully, it&#x2019;s not enough to just execute perfectly in the present&#x2014;you also need to have some idea regarding the future, the manner in which it will bring about changes in the market, in your consumers and in your competitors. Some things will change rapidly, others far less so, some might not change at all, but to stay in business you need some appreciation for change, and the ability to adapt to it.In this respect, you&#x2019;d expect professional futurists to be something akin to the CEOs best friend, yet this is rarely the case. This mismatch is not entirely easy to understand, and is particularly galling to many futurists, who wouldn&#x2019;t mind in the least being besties with a CEO. For them, the explanation is simple&#x2014;corporate executives just don&#x2019;t &#x201C;get it&#x201D;. But, I have another theory.The key reason for the decline of business futurism is not that executives don&#x2019;t get it, nor that futurism is just too &#x201C;out there&#x201D; for the staid cultures of the contemporary corporation. In fact, the opposite is true. Futurism today is too common, too bland and too non-challenging to be taken seriously by executives who see the future unfolding in front of them at speeds unmatched by even the most frantically keynote-happy futurist.Once upon a time, futurism was truly uncommon thinking. It reveled in the <em>outr&#xE9;,</em>&#xA0;in the taboo, in the unthinkable. During the 1950&#x2019;s and the 1960&#x2019;s, even partially into the 1970&#x2019;s, futurists were proposing daring, counterintuitive and at times positively mind-shattering visions. The futurism of this era was gleefully uncommon, challenging and anti-establishment. And then something happened.Futurism&#x2014;at least a great deal of it&#x2014;became less interested in pushing the boundaries of knowledge and more interested in commodifying specific images of the future&#x2014;call it the keynotification of futurism. It became less interested in shocking and challenging, and more interested in being seen as legitimate, proper and palatable. It became less and less uncommon and as a result duller and duller.Listen to a contemporary futurist or read a modern magazine on the same, and you&#x2019;ll come away with a distinct feeling of having heard it all before. The futurists of today are busy speaking of things such as drones, big data, sustainability, robots and 3D-printing (<em>always with the 3D-printing!</em>), making them almost indistinguishable from journalists covering modern technology, who write about the same subjects.Futurism has become common. It has become a way to feed back to us the very ideas we&#x2019;ve already seen, already read about, and in some cases, already experienced. I&#x2019;ve been treated to a futurist who excitedly explained the coming age of home manufacturing and who deflated only slightly at the mention that I&#x2019;d already played around with a MakerBot several years back.This is also why most corporate executives could care less about the majority of what goes for futurism today&#x2014;they already see far more extreme things happening all around them. They see it in the corporate labs, among their competitors and in their market space. It&#x2019;s not that executives don&#x2019;t get it, it&#x2019;s that they&#x2019;ve already gotten it, sometimes long before the self-proclaimed professionals of the future.What we need is more uncommon futurism. A futurism that cares not a whit about what&#x2019;s hot right now, who remain stoically unimpressed by drones and wearable IT, but who instead take it as their job to shock and awe CEOs with visions as radical as those of the futurists of yore. We need futurism that is less interested in agreeing with contemporary futurists and their ongoing circle-jerk, who take pride in offending and disgusting those futurists who would like to protect <em>the status quo.</em>It is not easy to be an uncommon futurist. The future seems to unfold so clearly and rapidly that it&#x2019;s easy to be bewitched by it. It&#x2019;s easy to just follow the trends of today and extrapolate from them, although the very notion of futurism was supposed to be a bulwark against such simplifications. Nor should we discount the group-think of futurism. Speak of the same thing as the other futurists, and you&#x2019;re sure to be met with nods and friendly smiles &#x2013; &#x201C;that&#x2019;s what I think, too!&#x201D; Question the scenarios of clean-tech and nano-tech so routinely trotted out, and you&#x2019;ll find yourself a pariah.But maybe that&#x2019;s what you should be. Maybe that&#x2019;s who the CEO wants as a BFF. The uncommon thinker, the pariah who sees the futures other people don&#x2019;t.So regardless of whether you are a futurist, want to be a futurist, or simply are in business and therefore a practical futurist, consider your futures thinking. Are the futures you foresee those that others can easily agree with, commonly shared visions repeated in the pages of <em>Wired</em>&#xA0;and <em>Fast Company&#x2014;</em>or can you push yourself further?Put somewhat differently: When you&#x2019;re presenting your ideas of the future, are people nodding or shaking their heads? If they&#x2019;re nodding, your futures are common and easy to agree with. This also means that they&#x2019;re unlikely to matter, even unlikely to come true&#x2014;as the future has a nasty habit of surprising us and going against that which is seen as &#x201C;common sense&#x201D;. If people are shaking their heads, you have in all likelihood come up with something just a little more uncommon, a little more challenging, something with much more power to change thinking and thereby the world. In other words, you might just have stumbled into serious futurism.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Over the last four years I have been through a lot of &#x201C;starts&#x201D;. Leaving home, going to college, studying abroad, working at six different jobs, choosing a career path, graduating college, moving back home and officially entering adulthood. My particular phase of life is a series of starts and finishes that come fast and hard. It feels like any time I get the hang of what was originally new I have to move on to another new beginning. But all of these starts have taught me something about adulthood, <em>most people are just winging it.</em><strong>Ignorance is bliss<br></strong>As a child I thought the adults in my life had everything figured out. I thought they had the answers to the most important questions and the solutions to every problem. I trusted that they knew what they were doing and that they always had a plan.<strong>Things that aren&#x2019;t real: Santa Claus, magic and adult omniscience<br></strong>As I have moved from adolescence into emerging adulthood I have begun to realize that the belief I held as a child surrounding this magic adult knowledge was just another beautiful illusion of the childhood bubble. At first my newfound knowledge &#x2013; that people are simply doing the best they can, making educated guesses and hoping for a positive outcome &#x2013; was alarming. It made me realize that at no point would I suddenly have everything figured out.&#xA0;<strong>Novelty means inevitable uncertainty<br></strong>But the more I have come to accept the knowledge that we are all just wingin&#x2019; it, the more comfortable I have become with starts. No one has it figured out when they begin something new &#x2013; that&#x2019;s what makes it a start. And that&#x2019;s also where the beauty lies. We take what life gives us or we go after what&#x2019;s important to us, we do the best we can with the knowledge and skills we possess, and then we do our best to learn the rest.<strong>Confidence comes from falling on your ass and discovering you can get back up<br></strong>After you experience enough starts you develop a sense of confidence that can only come with living. In the past four years I have realized that I don&#x2019;t always need a concrete plan, I don&#x2019;t have to know how to do everything perfectly, and it&#x2019;s not necessary to have all the answers. In fact, asking questions is often far more productive. And screwing up is when you learn the most.<strong>&#xA0;</strong><strong>The only thing you have to know is how to learn<br></strong>It turns out that the only thing I need to enter a new start is the knowledge that I am capable of learning. If I give something my 110% best effort I will learn, and eventually I will begin to have the answers. As you learn you begin to work out what you&#x2019;re doing and feel less like you&#x2019;re winging it. But nobody, no matter how many starts they have had, has the answers to everything.<strong>Lean into the fear and go for it<br></strong>It&#x2019;s so easy not to start something because you feel incompetent &#x2013; sometimes it feels like everyone else is more qualified than you. But throw yourself in there anyway. Allow yourself to be humbled by having no idea what you&#x2019;re doing and working your butt off to learn.Because the art of the start is not beginning with perfection or sage wisdom. The real art of the start is beginning with the knowledge that you have the ability to learn and the drive to do what it&#xA0;takes to grow and excel. Until then, wing it until you fly.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

For the rest of the evening I found myself in wonderment of &#x2018;The Mushroom Men&#x2019;; two college students whose lightbulb moment quickly turned into a multi-million dollar, sustainable business.Eben Bayer and Gavin McIntyre are two men who took their professor&#x2019;s advice and pursued an idea that erupted from a class project. While devising an eco-friendly glue for a class on invention, Bayer remembered a certain white substance (mycelium&#x2014;the root of a mushroom) that contains glue-like properties that he&#x2019;d come in contact with as a child, and thought &#x201C;Why not use mushroom roots as glue?&#x201D;Bayer&#x2019;s college professor encouraged him and classmate, Gavin McIntyre to pursue the idea. In a short while the two were growing the wet, rubbery fungus in their college apartment. The classroom project quickly turned into a sustainable business model when the two men discovered that the mushroom glue was actually strong enough to bind together objects like cornhusks and rice. When baked with various farming by-products the glue becomes even stronger, producing a styrofoam-like substance. In 2007, Bayer and McIntyre co-founded Ecovative Design.Evocative Design provides natural, sustainable, biodegradable alternatives to plastics and other products such as styrofoam. Utilizing materials that are environmentally friendly like mycelium and agricultural by-products that are100% biodegradable and renewable, Ecovative Design hopes to create a more sustainable future by eliminating harmful disposable plastics from the world.Unlike other bio-plastics, their technology isn&#x2019;t based on turning food or fuel crops into materials. Instead they use only inedible waste from farming crops to grow their products, which results in efficient biodegradable materials that have a variety of uses, are environmentally friendly, and affordable. This innovative bio-material has won a number of prestigious packaging awards, protecting products for some big name customers.Currently, Ecovative Design is working with 3M to adopt the mycelium technology platform for new market opportunities and spaces. They have also partnered with Sealed Air to accelerate the adoption of <a href=\"http://www.ecovativedesign.com/applications/ecocradle-packaging\" target=\"_blank\">EcoCradle packaging</a>. The Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory will use Ecovative&#x2019;s EcoCradle mushroom material to protect the DART-ETD system during deployment when the buoy is dropped off the deck of a ship into the ocean. Testing conducted by NOAA has shown that EcoCradle can withstand prolonged exposure to tropical shipping conditions, short term direct exposure to rain, and sea spray (as experienced on the back deck of a ship), and then break down in both fresh and salt water in a period of less than 5 months, so as not to contribute to the ocean&#x2019;s plastic gyres. Given NOAA&#x2019;s needs, EcoCradle provides the perfect solution in a low-cost, moldable, 100% bio-based alternative to traditional petrochemical foams. In the future, Ecovative Design sees themselves as a primary source for science materials&#x2014;adapting living systems to create useful materials and products that are beneficial to people and our planet.Bayer and McIntyre&#x2019;s story continues to intrigue and inspire me. People have light bulb moments every day but they generally don&#x2019;t have the courage to act on them. The voice of reason and/or self-doubt creeps in, dims the light, and shatters the confidence that creativity needs to thrive. Those who ignore that voice and see through the dim light create ingenious ideas, and generate solutions that can continue to change the world.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

Taking an active strategic role in the early stage of this brand, we&#x2019;ve helped two passionate founders&#x2013;Elisa Hills and Erika McKellar&#x2013;take their idea from garage to shelf.Elisa and Erika were inspired by our Uncommon Truth: <strong>Gratitude is the Attitude</strong> and wanted to uncommonly express gratitude to those who have supported their entrepreneurial journey.<em>&#x201C;We can&#x2019;t tell you how many times we&#x2019;ve said the words &#x2018;thank you&#x2019;, but it never feels like enough, probably because we&#x2019;ve said it so many times. So, in an attempt to express our gratitude and evoke deeper meaning than the ostensible &#x2018;thank you&#x2019; we&#x2019;ve written you all a love poem.

       "content_body":"Why understanding the meaning of diversity and inclusion is an imperative for family, friendships, business and the world at large.At the end of last summer, I invited my friend Michael to dinner as his wife was out of town. We hadn&#x2019;t seen each other in a while and we had a lot to catch up on. My wife and thirteen-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, joined us and as we sat down to eat the two men did what most men do, we talked, a lot. We opined a lot and thought we were solving the world&#x2019;s problems. It was a great dinner with amazing conversation. Or so I thought. After Michael left, my daughter asked me to sit back down. Then she proceeded to share how frustrated she was, how we had both spoken over her and my wife during dinner. She pointed out how we&#x2019;d ignored them as we talked about the politics of the moment. We made her feel invisible and that her opinions didn&#x2019;t count. I was stunned and apologized profusely. And as I listened intently, my wife shared how men speak past her in social situations, how they don&#x2019;t really listen and how it has happened to her most of her life. My daughter said the same thing happens with male teachers, coaches and boys at school. My older daughter then joined the conversation and shared the same experiences. It happens to women all the time.This was a rude awakening for me. I&#x2019;d always thought of myself as being self-aware and considerate in both my personal and professional life. I was sure that I knew what being inclusive meant. But it took my youngest daughter to point out what I&#x2019;d been unintentionally missing. As we talked about it in more detail, I realized that being inclusive was multi-dimensional and I, as a husband, father, leader and friend had an obligation to be more open, more inclusive and more supportive. I left the table committed to starting the same conversation at Bulldog. After sharing this story with the team and acknowledging I&#x2019;ve unintentionally done the same at work, we formed a group to lead a long-term initiative to help everyone at Bulldog understand what diversity and inclusion means and to look at how we can be more open and inclusive as a team. For one, I now consciously try to create more space for others, in conversations, in meetings and I check my enthusiasm for the mic and try to pay much more attention to those I&#x2019;m in conversation with. Especially with those less inclined to speak up.If you&#x2019;re a man in a position of influence or leadership today, take the time to reflect and understand the meaning of diversity and inclusion. In so doing, honestly look at how you&#x2019;re showing up, look for the gaps and blind spots that you have and be open to change. Examine the behavioral changes you need to make and the actions you need to take, and open the door to meaningful positive change in other people&#x2019;s lives in each of the places you have a leadership role. And while you&#x2019;re at it, take the time to sincerely thank the women in your life for what they do and for how they&#x2019;ve helped to shape you.For the past 15 years, I&#x2019;ve had the privilege of working with a group of immensely talented women at Bulldog Drummond who have given their all, brought their talents to the work we do and have made Bulldog the very special place it is. I feel fortunate to have been surrounded by you as colleagues. You often feel like human mirrors, honestly reflecting back what you hear and see in me, helping me to do what I do. Along with my amazing wife and two daughters, the women at Bulldog have helped and challenged me to be more open and self-aware, more considerate and to be open to change.&#xA0;March is a special month because we get to celebrate women. On behalf of the men at Bulldog, I&#x2019;d like to celebrate and thank each of you for all you do. Annie, Lisa, Megan, Erin, Cat, Erin, Katie, Colleen, Krystle, Tiffany, Brett, Emma, Amber and Erika, thank you for what you do for Bulldog every day. I respect each of you for your individual talents and for the time and energy that you invest in Bulldog. I appreciate and learn from your unique and different perspectives, your passion, patience and tenacity for the work that we do together as a team.To the amazing women at Bulldog Drummond, you make us better together, every day.&#xA0;<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gA8X5rBw0uc\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>&#xA0;<span class=\"s1\"><em>Read more from <a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/filter/shawn-parr#filters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Shawn</a>.&#xA0;</em></span><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Right now I am sitting in a quaint little coffee shop overlooking the infamous London skyline, delighted by the smell of freshly roasted coffee and the buzz of conversations in the air. As I sit nibbling on biscuits and listening to the sultry sounds of Miles Davis, I realize it&#x2019;s the perfect place to fuel my passion for both food and brands.Over the past five years living in London, I&#x2019;ve enjoyed food at some of the strangest and most wonderful places. From the latest food trends at market stalls, to fun and faddy pop-ups, to Michelin star restaurants, I love introducing my taste buds to exciting new flavors I never knew existed.<strong>Stop, Collaborate and Listen (and Share)<br> </strong>It was only this past week, after reading one of my favorite top chef&#x2019;s secret recipes, I realized the potential of collaboration. The ingredients for making the perfect mash, is &#x201C;50% potato, 50% butter&#x201D;&#x2014;and the majority of mash doesn&#x2019;t taste this good because people don&#x2019;t have the guts to go 50/50 on this killer combination! I was shocked (mainly because I had probably been eating my weight in butter over the past few months) but also at the power of a 50/50 collaboration.<strong>Mashed Potatoes and Brands<br> </strong>I don&#x2019;t need to spend long discussing the success of brand collaborations, especially considering the roaring successes of high fashion and street brands like Versace &amp; H+M or Stella McCartney &amp; Gap.&#xA0;This type of collaboration model involves each brand sharing the fame and profit 50/50, and doesn&#x2019;t necessarily create an internal innovation culture among brands within the same portfolio.What I find most interesting is when we begin to look at companies that are collaborating with brands under the same parent company. Take Mondelez for example&#x2014;after acquiring Cadbury in 2009 they&#x2019;ve experienced a number of great innovations and created successful new products by leveraging their extensive brand portfolio. I can imagine that pulling off this type of collaboration in CPG is a no-brainer, especially when all the brands share the same reason to believe and, in this case, they are all delicious.Another type of internal collaboration we&#x2019;re beginning to see is the sharing of a brand&#x2019;s technology or patented material with other brands within the company portfolio. For instance, Adidas owns the Rockport brand, and in 2010 Rockport released a line of shoes enhanced by adiPRENE (an Adidas patented material/technology). It makes sense because adiPRENE is perfect for people who want to experience sneaker-like comfort in their dress shoes. This type of collaboration is a real win-win for consumers and the brand collaborators.Large corporations constantly pour money into creating new technologies and materials for their individual brands, but why not use the insights to fuel and further build brands internally? Or, like these examples, share insights with like-minded companies and brands to create an experience for people. This not only saves environmental and fiscal resources, but also creates a platform for innovation&#x2014;fueling both the company and its customers. It makes me wonder how many other brands could leverage by sharing, collaborating and mashing-up their traditions and processes to learn, share, give, and create&#x2014;together.The list of brilliant brand collaborations goes on, so let&#x2019;s carry this discussion further. Share the spirit of Heston Blumenthal and share your recipes and secrets. A bit of curiosity and a collaborative mindset can provide insight that fuels each stage of a business&#x2014;so lets learn from brand collaborations. Have you read an article about an amazingly successful brand collaboration, or perhaps heard about the chance of a collaboration of two brilliant brands?I will leave you with one question: could this lead to companies like Lamb Weston buying brands like Kerrygold Butter? #theperfectmash<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Designing disruptive, original solutions to existing problems and breakthrough products in existing markets is hard&#x2013;&#x2013;really hard. To increase the odds of success, a company must think and act in uncommon ways. Take the time to step back and evaluate what&#x2019;s working, what could be simplified and streamlined, and most importantly be open to change.Our <strong>IMAGINE IF</strong> principle is dedicated to innovation and encouraging diverse thinking in business and life. We hope to inspire people, companies and brands to create and foster environments for innovation. Here are four UNCOMMON SENSE learnings to encourage innovation:<strong>Don&#x2019;t be afraid to think big</strong>Innovation is hard, because it means finding new and original ways to solve a problem, or inventing something completely new. Don&#x2019;t be afraid to have a bold vision. There will be barriers and people in the way, and the journey is laden with challenges, reasons to quit, and opportunities to take the easy way out. It takes incredible determination to think big and overcome the obstacles to success.<strong>Do something new for the first time</strong>In the search for what&#x2019;s next, we often forget what &#x201C;new&#x201D; really feels like. Remind yourself what it feels like to experience something new for the very first time. Plan opportunities to do the sublime and the ridiculous for the first time. Challenge yourself to sky dive, jump into an improv class, start a garden, make a batch of kombucha, plan an InnovationFest, take an engine apart and put it back together or take a calligraphy class. Do something new for the first time, record and discuss the observations, and then share what you learned.<strong>Think like a CEO and run like a startup</strong>If the challenge is disruptive, put an agile, cross-functional team made up of the most unique and passionate people you can find. Make sure the challenge is crystal clear, then let the team design the best way to move forward. Spend more time on idea development and less time building presentations. Remove as many barriers to success as possible, and organize the team to operate like a hungry startup.&#xA0;Then put a sense of urgency, energy and competition into the innovation process.<strong>Celebrate and communicate your successes</strong>Innovation is hard for many reasons, and having the fortitude to keep swinging takes a combination of capability, commitment, courage, and communication. It&apos;s important to communicate regularly with humility and pride about the successes and the failures that you and your teams encounter. &#xA0;<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"It is impossible to use a singular metric to define &#x201C;successful people&#x201D;. Common sense would have us believe that there is a formula for success, but #UncommonSense tells us that success looks different for everyone. It would be safe to say Richard Branson, Jenna Lyons and Lebron James are all successful people. Each one comes from a very different background, achieved success very differently and lives a unique life that suits them. But, the one thing that successful people have in common is that their path to success is uniquely theirs&#x2014;and at a certain point in their career they broke societal convention to carve it themselves.<strong>Establish the skills you need to</strong> <strong>dream bigger </strong>At the beginning of one&#x2019;s career there is typically a goal to be like someone else&#x2026; golf like Tiger Woods, paint like Monet or make money like Gordon Gekko. As a career progresses a person&#x2019;s skills become established and personal perspectives and opinions develop, allowing that individual to let their target for success shift. At some point in his career, Lebron decided he did not want to play basketball like Michael Jordan but instead take advantage of his own skill set to become the best basketball player in the world&#x2014;and he put in the work to do it.<strong>Design your success plan</strong>As a person&#x2019;s career goals are redefined, a plan to successfully achieve them needs to evolve. When world-class marathon runners start a race they are solely fixated on their stride and pace. They&#x2019;ve put in the practice, testing and time to be self-aware and comfortable with their plan to win. With the realization that following anyone else&#x2019;s plan will be detrimental to their plans success.Successful individualism is apparent when looking at the eyewear manufacturer, <a href=\"https://www.warbyparker.com\">Warby Parker</a> who ignored the norms of the eyewear business to become an icon for <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3039573/most-innovative-companies-2015/warby-parker\">innovation</a> within their industry. They didn&#x2019;t want to be a new version of LensCrafters, and brand name eyewear was already being sold direct-to-consumers on Amazon&#x2014;these avenues were the tried and true models of eyewear retail. Warby Parker set out with their own mission to create a business of stylish affordable well-made eyewear. The partners at Warby Parker innovated within their industry with offerings like sample shipping, custom products and fashion-forward styling targeted at a specific demographic.<strong>Follow your plan unconditionally</strong>Just as the principle of individualism has been successful for Warby Parker, they can also be applied to personal life goals. Removing any notion of the <em>right way</em> to do something, people can arrive at a clear vision of their goals and the steps needed to achieve them. When we put faith in our personal goals, and ourselves we become free from the confines of others&#x2019; expectations. If your approach is different than others&#x2019; there is no measuring stick for competitors and you will likely achieve your goal. If you&#x2019;re running a marathon, starting a business or innovating in any way, take advantage of the freedom to create true success by running your own race. &#xA0;&#xA0;<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Oftentimes, people don&#x2019;t know what they are capable of until they are truly pushed beyond their limits. If one swims to the bottom of a pool and holds their breath, odds are good that they&#x2019;ll come for air after just thirty seconds&#x2014;but diving under water as a 15-foot wave crashes overhead, they would most likely be able to hold their breath for much longer than they ever thought possible. Life is just the same&#x2014;extreme personal and professional growth comes during the most difficult times through challenges that push us further than we&#x2019;ve ever been before. These moments of weathering the storm are what truly define who we are as a person.I was lucky to have one weathered one such storm in my life. A few years ago, I went on a training ride to prepare for a half Ironman. In one moment, I was riding my bike and in the next, I was waking up on the side of the road coughing up blood. By virtue of a driver&#x2019;s ill-timed and illegal u-turn, I had crashed into the side of a car going 24 MPH. Over the course of the next month, I discovered the extent of my injuries and underwent several invasive surgeries, and eventually learned to stand up straight again. The many months after that accident were some of the most difficult, yet formative days of my life as I learned exactly how long I could hold my breath&#x2014;and push myself as a person.The first step is to acknowledge that you are in storm&#x2014;surfers, sailors, and anyone who lives near the water constantly monitor the weather and look at what&#x2019;s ahead so they don&#x2019;t get caught off guard. Personally, it took a while to admit how difficult things were, but once I did, I was able to realize that my situation could get infinitely better. When you are taking on a major challenge, if you can recognize that it&#x2019;s going to be a tough road ahead, you&#x2019;re already ahead of the game. As G.I. Joe famously said, &#x201C;&#x201D;Now you know, and knowing is half the battle.&#x201D;It&#x2019;s important to admire the beauty amongst the chaos and celebrate what seems to be the small stuff. While in the midst of a major challenge, people find it&#x2019;s easy to become so wrapped up in their personal storms, they forget to stop and look around. When driving under 20-foot surf, it&#x2019;s easy to miss the beautiful channels of turbulence. Sometimes we forget to admire the pelting mist blowing off the back of a wave, or the pelicans soaring just feet above the water. But all these moments of beauty are incredibly important to recognize even in the midst of the storm.I found great joy when I hit small moments and realized they were, in fact, major accomplishments. For months I couldn&#x2019;t lift my arm high enough to brush or floss my teeth, and I celebrated the day I finally could. Similarly, while in the midst of a professional storm, take time to acknowledge the small successes&#x2014;an elegant solution to a complex problem, a truly remarkable meeting or even a well-crafted response to a challenging question can be a small victory in what will be a much larger war. These simple moments should be acknowledged and celebrated, as they provide motivation for the long journey ahead.One of the hardest aspects to accept is that we can navigate through a storm, but we can&#x2019;t control the ocean. We need to learn to control what we can in our own lives, and let everything else go. I suddenly possessed a body that wasn&#x2019;t healing nearly as quickly as I&#x2019;d like and was entirely reliant on a team of doctors, nurses, and physical therapists. Although frustrated, I was determined to take control of what I could to get my body and my life back, which meant spending six hours every day in rehabilitation, acupuncture, and massage therapy. There are many times in our professional life when we are also at the mercy of others&#x2014;macroeconomic factors or even elements within our industries or companies. What we can do is control our own business and focus on what is in our power and sphere of influence.But, it&#x2019;s also essential to recognize that growth of any kind can be painful and scary. Acknowledging my fear enabled me to channel this energy into a positive direction. As a longtime athlete, I was inspired by a quote about Laird Hamilton, one of the greatest big wave surfers, that says, &#x201C;What&#x2019;s so interesting about Laird and athletes like Laird, they are just as afraid, but they deal with it differently.&#x201D; The ability to work through fear is not unique to athletes, and the ability to channel this fear and charge ahead can be utilized in all areas of life.The classic line from Stan Lee&#x2019;s <em>Spider Man</em> says, &#x201C;With great power comes great responsibility,&#x201D; and a professional challenge is very similar. You have been entrusted with a company, business, role, or campaign and are expected to be successful. Whenever put in such a situation, you have great power within that storm and a great opportunity for incredible growth. Never let any storm pass you by without taking the chance to ride it as far as you can.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

Retail brands, on the other hand, are continuing to grow year by year. The rise of the middle class means people have more money to spend, but also more opportunities to vote with their wallet when it comes to supporting brands that are worth it.<br><br>What makes a brand worth supporting? We can turn to outdoor brands to find our answers. The likes of Patagonia, Cotopaxi, and Kathmandu are reformulating what a socially conscious brand looks like&#x2014;one that truly cares for the welfare of humans and respects the environment we live in.<br><br><strong>Consistency</strong><br><br>Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard is well known for walking the walk when it comes to environmental conservation.&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90411397/exclusive-patagonia-founder-yvon-chouinard-talks-about-the-sustainability-myth-the-problem-with-amazon-and-why-its-not-too-late-to-save-the-planet\">Chouinard has been disparaging the effects of climate change as early as 1994</a>, but continued to use Patagonia as a way to educate people on climate change and provide a model for other businesses who want to be environmentally sustainable.<br><br>It&#x2019;s this kind of commitment to their advocacy that makes outdoor brands the perfect example for how to sustain a business model. Since these brands make their products for the environment, they&#x2019;re fully attuned to how the natural landscape is changing.<br><br><strong>Transparency</strong><br><br>On the subject of commitment, lots of outdoor brands are known for disclosing their manufacturing processes and materials in an effort to be more transparent and ethical.&#xA0;<a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/how-brands-that-take-a-stand-can-help-consumers-with-climate-anxiety-but-they-have-to-be-authentic-about-it\">Greener Solutions CEO Catherine Greener stressed that it&#x2019;s not enough to use terms like &#x2018;organic&#x2019; and &#x2018;sustainable&#x2019;</a>&#xA0;to capture consumer interest.<br><br>Vague nods to sustainability and social good can even put you in hot water.

       "content_body":"Designing disruptive, original solutions to existing problems and breakthrough products and solutions in existing markets is hard. Really hard. When we have the opportunity to work with some of the world&#x2019;s largest brands and most intelligent individuals, we often find that many organizations make the design process more difficult than necessary. They are overly dependent on cumbersome, time-consuming, unmotivating processes with too many uninformed opinions and notions.To increase the odds of success, a company must think and behave like a start-up.&#xA0;When it comes to cracking a problem, begin with placing the most talented, cross-functional team of passionate, focused, and motivated people together. With the problem or challenge crystal clear, let the team decide the best way to go from discovery to execution in the most streamlined manner so they can spend more time on idea development and execution, rather than hours building presentations.&#xA0;Remove as many distracting barriers to success as possible, and set the team up to operate like a determined and hungry start-up.We are often asked why we work with start-ups, social entrepreneurs and not-for-profits. Our answer: they keep us fresh, on our toes, and remind us how and why great ideas become great businesses (or not). Start-ups are scrappy and inspire the daylights out of my team, reminding us daily that innovation is hard, that it&#x2019;s messy and it&#x2019;s not just about a process, but instead about passionately and persistently trying to solve a problem. It&#x2019;s the maniacal focus on execution, and the fortitude to overcome mistakes and failures because their lives depend on it. While process and group input are important within organizations, sometimes the amount of time, people and road blocks that are put in front of innovation teams is what kills great ideas early and slows their execution.&#xA0;Start-ups must execute or they are finished. This relentless persistence of &#x201C;get it done&#x201D; is the fuel in our tank that we use with our global clients every day, and have affectionately termed&#x2013;Get Stuff Done.<strong>THE FIVE UNCOMMON SENSE PRINCIPLES OF GSD&#xA0;</strong>By directly asking our clients and their innovation teams what can be simplified, we have been able to help large companies streamline their process significantly. It&#x2019;s important to step back and evaluate what works, what needs simplifying, what can be streamlined, and always be open to change. Putting a sense of urgency, energy and competition into the innovation process sharpens mind and the iron. To initiate your teams into thinking like a start-up, here are the five simple GSD principles we follow:<strong>1. What&#x2019;s the problem?&#xA0;</strong><br> Clearly state the problem you&#x2019;re trying to solve, and the opportunity you&#x2019;re charged with uncovering. Put this is into a clear, single page project brief that can easily be shared with all teams involved.<strong>2. Who&#x2019;s your daddy?</strong><br> Choose a highly-motivated, cross-functional team and brief them on the problem they&#x2019;re tasked with solving.<strong>3. What is success?</strong><br> Set clear expectations with a project brief, timeline and a definition of success. Also, create an incentive-based performance bonus structure for achieving the goal.<strong>4. What do you need?</strong><br> Determine the critical resources the team needs to solve the problem at hand. What do you currently have, and what&#x2019;s missing that is a necessity?<strong>5. Get to it.</strong><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span><em>Photo: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/mararie/2844902161/\" target=\"_blank\">mararie</a></em>"

       "content_body":"The Louis Vuitton brand recently named designer Virgil Abloh as creative director for menswear&#x2014;and for good reason. Abloh is known for making luxury fashion relatable across generations and has been on a mission to make streetwear more credible for years.<em>&quot;In a large part streetwear is seen as cheap. What my goal has been is to add an intellectual layer to it and make it credible.&quot;</em> - <a href=\"https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/intelligence/the-unlikely-success-of-virgil-abloh-off-white\">Virgil Abloh</a>His story is an inspiring one.At 22 years of age, Abloh was hired as Kanye West&apos;s creative consultant, encompassing everything from videos and stage design to merchandise and album covers. Seven years later he and West sought an internship with Fendi (<em>at a reported </em><a href=\"https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/kanye-west-virgil-abloh-fendi-internship/\"><em>$500 monthly salary</em></a>), and Abloh left an impression on the brand leader at the time, Michael Burke<em>. &#x201C;I was really impressed with how they brought a whole new vibe to the studio and were disruptive in the best way. Virgil could create a metaphor and a new vocabulary to describe something as old-school as Fendi. I have been following his career ever since.&#x201D; </em>- <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/26/business/louis-vuitton-virgil-abloh.html\">The New York Times</a>A few years later, he began building Pyrex Vision, his first fashion label, which launched in New York and sparked what some would say was the streetwear movement. The brand, which initially sold custom screen-printed Champion T-shirts and vintage Ralph Lauren flannels with hefty profit margins, quickly gained a cult following. &quot;<em>Pyrex attracted influential retailers like Colette (Paris), Union (Los Angeles), GR8 (Tokyo) and Storm (Copenhagen), and was sold next to luxury labels like Balmain, C&#xE9;line and Givenchy</em>.&quot; - <a href=\"https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/intelligence/the-unlikely-success-of-virgil-abloh-off-white\">Business of Fashion </a>&#xA0;Just a year later, Abloh concluded the Pyrex Vision brand and started <a href=\"https://www.off---white.com/en/US\">Off-White.</a> In an interview with <a href=\"https://www.teenvogue.com/story/virgil-abloh-interview\">Teen Vogue</a> Abloh said, &quot;<em>I realized that Pyrex Vision was an art piece. It was a one-time thing. And that I wanted to do something lasting. I also wanted to think of a concept that didn&apos;t tie me down to my original concept. My goal was to tell a dialogue between high fashion and streetwear. So, the name Off-White, in my mind, is between black and white. So, that middle ground is a mixture between both genres of fashion.</em>&quot; The brand pulls inspiration from all over&#x2014;he&#x2019;s mentioned his deep infatuation with Montauk and Martha Stewart and Nantucket. The multi-platform creative endeavor mixes the ideas of streetwear, luxury, art, music and travel and launched at Fashion Week in Paris. Since its launch, Off-White has collaborated with major brands&#x2014;from Nike to Jimmy Choo to IKEA, just to name a few.<em>&#x201C;I want to prove this new iteration of fashion and use Off-White as a case study for these new ideas that relate to current consumers, because at the end of the day it&apos;s an industry I believe in.&#x201D; - </em><a href=\"https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/intelligence/the-unlikely-success-of-virgil-abloh-off-white\">Virgil Abloh in Business of Fashion</a>The Off-White and Nike brand collaboration sold out in just a few minutes, and they continue to create new works together like the recently released capsule collection which includes a <a href=\"https://www.designboom.com/design/virgil-abloh-off-white-nike-collaboration-world-cup-05-31-2018/\">line inspired by the World Cup</a>. Last year, the designer released a collaborative pair of Nike Zoom Fly sneakers as part of &#x201C;The Ten&#x201D; collection. The sneaker series, which involved deconstructing and reimagining ten Nike footwear classics, has been detailed in a recent release of <a href=\"https://content.nike.com/content/dam/one-nike/en_us/season-2018-su/NikeLab/TEN/TEXTBOOK.pdf\">TEXTBOOK</a>, a chronicle outlining Abloh&#x2019;s design process.<em>&quot;&#x2018;We&apos;ve come to a crescendo where we&apos;re finding out that people actually want what we think the world wants, which is something more authentic and pure.

He is his brand, and it is a part of everything he does. He&apos;s not only inspired by youth culture, but he remains an active part of it. He&#x2019;s transforming the fashion industry and is aware of, even amused by, the contradiction inherent in parlaying his uncommon approach and widespread acceptance in the fashion and design world.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span><em>Photo: <a href=\"https://www.designboom.com/design/virgil-abloh-off-white-nike-collaboration-world-cup-05-31-2018/\" target=\"_blank\">DesignBoom</a></em>"

       "content_body":"Humanity washed ashore.Humanity washed ashore.Let those words resonate for a minute. Let the weight sit heavy on your shoulders. Let the implications sink deep into your soul.Humanity washed ashore.I have an 8-month old son named Jack, and this is how he sleeps at night. He lies on his belly, with his head to the side, and his little sweet hands tucked underneath his body. The difference is that Jack is lying next to his mom and dad. He&#x2019;s protected, comfortable and safe. And he&#x2019;s breathing. Little Aylan is not. He&#x2019;s wet, he&#x2019;s cold, and he&#x2019;s alone. His eyes, nose and mouth are likely caked with sand. And except for the waves washing against his arms and legs, his body has stopped moving and his last breath is gone.Aylan won&#x2019;t play ball. He won&#x2019;t laugh with his friends. And, he won&#x2019;t kiss his mother good night. He won&#x2019;t feel the sadness of loss and the joy of true love. He won&#x2019;t meet his wife someday and he&#x2019;ll never understand what it feels like to see his face in that of his children.Humanity washed ashore.In Aylan&#x2019;s little body is a promise unkept. A promise horribly and irrevocably broken. The promise? To create and uphold a world that values humanity. A place where our sons and daughters can grow up free&#x2014;free to be, free to explore, free to decide and free to dream.Every night I tell Jack that the world will be what he makes of it. I tell him that he has the opportunity to do anything, and that he has a whole lifetime to explore the beauty and wonder of the planet we live on. That&#x2019;s what mothers do. The problem is that I don&#x2019;t really believe the things I say. Not will all my heart. And despite their grave situation, I bet Aylan&#x2019;s mother said the same thing to him.There are hundreds of thousands of people around the world who will go without eating today, because of corrupt governments, tyrannical political systems and fanatical fundamentalism. In our own country, an increasing number of people are becoming the victims of reckless, cruel and haphazard murders. Inner city violence continues to rage&#x2014;as does violence against the police. Young children are taking their own lives at an increasing rate due to a growing sense of hopelessness and fear about what their future holds. This is humanity washed ashore. This goes on because we let it. In some cases we start it. In other cases we perpetuate it. And in others, we simply pave the path by doing nothing.We all had a hand in Aylan&#x2019;s death. We had a hand through our action and inaction. Action in the choices we made and inaction in the choices we didn&#x2019;t, that either did or did not contribute to a better world. Aylan&#x2019;s father said, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t want anything else from this world. Everything I was dreaming of is gone. I want to bury my children and sit beside them until I die.&#x201D; He has each of us to thank.Humanity washed ashore.I believe that Aylan can do more in death than he ever could in life. But that&#x2019;s up to us. It&#x2019;s going to take us stepping back, taking a deeper look at humanity, deciding what it means to us, and then, if we think it&#x2019;s worth saving, take the steps to give humanity the respect, care and protection it deserves. What can we do?Start by reconnecting with the things that make you uniquely human. Laugh. Cry. Dream. Smile. Take a walk under the trees. Stare at the clouds. Just breathe. Feel who you are&#x2014;your unique humanness.Reconnect with the people around you. Look at your spouse. Hug your children and call your friends. Say hi to somebody on the street. Help a person struggling to get out of their car. We are all one. When we step outside of ourselves and understand this at a deep level we can no longer sit idly by as atrocities happen. Others&#x2019; pain is our pain&#x2014;what happens to one of us happens to all of us.Answer these questions for yourself. What do you value about humanity? Is humanity worth saving? And are you willing to enter the ring to protect humanity, nurture it, and preserve it for the next generation?If your answer is yes, then it&#x2019;s time to get angry&#x2014;incredibly and irrevocably angry&#x2014;and use that anger to inspire action. Begin by reading, studying and learning. Become intimately aware of what&#x2019;s going on in the world as a prelude to taking action. And then determine where you&#x2019;ll take your first step. For some, it might be doing more in your local community to help those who are suffering. For others, it might be flying to a country in need and lending a true and physical hand. <strong>What matters the most is that we&#x2019;re all actively working to protect and uphold humanity, because if we let it falter it will be your fault and it will be mine&#x2014;but it will be our children who suffer.</strong>Our future is not written, but it will be by what we choose to do next. It&#x2019;s time to be uncommon&#x2014;in thought, in action and in courage&#x2014;and ensure that what we&#x2019;ve built is never again left to wash up on shore.<em>Inspired to do something about the refugee crisis NOW? <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/5-practical-ways-you-can-help-refugees-trying-to-find-safety-in-europe-10482902.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Independent</a> has 5 practical ways you can immediately get involved</em>.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"One of my colleagues, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/meghkeaney\">Meghan Keaney Anderson</a>, is a top-notch leader. She&#x2019;s championed some of the most important efforts at our company over the past few years, and is regularly recognized as one of the organization&#x2019;s top managers, marketers, and mentors. And yet, one of my favorite things about Meghan is a necklace she wears regularly around the office. On it is a quote from Michel de Montaigne in French that translates roughly to, &#x201C;What do I know?&#x201D; In addition to being an artifact from one of her favorite writers, it&#x2019;s a daily reminder to stay humble and continue learning and growing.To me, Meghan embodies a trait of the best leaders I know: she constantly obsesses over getting better, and in doing so sets high expectations of herself, her team, and anyone who works with her on a daily basis. The result? You elevate your game when you meet with her, you check your ego at the door because you know she does the same, and you actively want to keep up with what she&#x2019;s reading, the events she&#x2019;s attending, and the people she&#x2019;s connecting with because you know she&#x2019;s focused on how she and the organization can get better.How can all of us follow Meghan&#x2019;s example and obsess about getting better?1)&#xA0;<strong>Always Be Learning:</strong> Between emails, calls, meetings, and management, it&#x2019;s hard to maintain a personal life, let alone find time to read. Yet, the best ideas often come from external input and experience. Setting the tone that reading regularly, meeting with people you want to learn from, and attending events and talks in your industry is not only encouraged, but required, is imperative.At <a href=\"http://www.hubspot.com\">HubSpot</a>, we make this as easy as possible through our Free Books Program, whereby any HubSpotter, at any time, can request a free book that helps them improve at their job. There&#x2019;s no formal approval process or requirement beyond the caveat that the book helps individual or professional growth. So there&#x2019;s no excuse not to read. Don&#x2019;t have a free book program? No sweat&#x2014;use <a href=\"http://www.theskimm.com/\">The Skimm</a> to stay current on news and trends or make it a weekly practice to share articles that inspire the whole team. Doing so keeps everyone honest about prioritizing external inspiration and education if only for twenty minutes each day.2) <strong>Sharpen Your Skills:</strong> It&#x2019;s really easy to get rusty at even your sharpest skills, so identify the top five skills you need to maintain or improve to grow your career and block time on your calendar each week to revisit them. <a href=\"http://smarterer.com/\">Smarterer</a> offers two-minute tests on hundreds of skills from Web Design to Word and Blogging to Business Grammar. Invest the time to test your current skill levels at the top skills important to you and then create a plan to tackle the ones that have accumulated dust over time.To use a personal example, throughout my career I have historically created a lot of content, but last year during a particularly demanding period of work, I found my writing was lackluster and I was no longer as efficient or effective at creating content. I took <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/opinion/uattr/beth-dunn-hubspot-inbound-conference-2013-bold-talk\">advice</a> from my masterful writing colleague <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bethdunn\">Beth Dunn</a> and started writing every day. By facing my skill gap head on and taking some actionable advice from a colleague, I was able to get back on track. Use your network and your knowledge to de-rust even your sharpest skills&#x2014;the results will speak for themselves.3) <strong>Take a Breather:</strong> Every few months, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbalfour\">Brian Balfour</a>, who leads HubSpot&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.getsidekick.com\">Sidekick </a>team, takes <a href=\"http://www.coelevate.com/essays/growth-principle-one-be-the-best-at-getting-better\">a day with his team</a> to reflect on how the team is working together and receive input from everyone on how they can collectively make their collaboration better. Doing this ensures that the team isn&#x2019;t comfortable with the status quo, and that everyone feels ownership for fixing areas that can be better versus being complacent. Some of the questions they ask themselves include identifying the lowest ROI tasks they have done, why they did them, and identify ways in which they can avoid doing more low-return projects. I love that lens as a function to prioritize time, energy, and investments. Simply put, hubris has a funny way of seeping into every organization and every team if you&#x2019;re not vigilant.Meghan&#x2019;s necklace is a great reminder that what we know pales in comparison to what we don&#x2019;t. Rather than be defeated by that perspective, learning more and getting better fuels the best leaders in the world. I just happen to be lucky enough to work with some of those leaders, and they remind me daily just how much I have to learn. &#xA0;&#xA0;<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"<em>The greatest thing about having a child is putting yourself second in your own life.</em>&#x2014;Louis C.K.My husband and I travel quite frequently for work. Usually, we sync our Google calendars and schedule our trips in quick succession, so one of us can be home with our three kids while the other is away. Occasionally, we enlist help from auntie or grandma when our engagements must overlap. Every once in awhile, we travel together, and bring the children with us.This is usually a mistake.&#xA0;One of our recent jaunts found us in Pacifica, an out-of-the-way surfing town just south of San Francisco. What we discovered there surprised us.On this particular trip, I hiked a trail high above the Pacific Ocean. It was glorious&#x2014;blue-green water, salty air, sweeping vistas. I breathed deep and counted blessings. My husband and I have neither wealth nor fame nor power, but we have love, purpose, and good kids. I felt lucky.It was warmer than I anticipated, so before heading up the switchback portion of the trail, I doubled back to my car for sunscreen and a hat. In the parking lot, I hesitated. This day was too amazing to keep to myself. I ventured to the nearby hotel to grab my family.Our three children were soaking in the in-room bathtub, eating mini-muffins, drinking cider, and watching the Disney Channel. My husband, Ken, was asleep.&#x201C;I found an awesome trail!&#x201D; I chirped.No one answered.&#x201C;Anyone want to hike?&#x201D;Still nothing. I stepped in front of the television.&#x201C;Mom, I can&#x2019;t see the TV.&#x201D;&#x201C;Move.&#x201D;&#x201C;Ugh!&#x201D;Ken muttered that he would come, but then rolled over and went back to sleep.That should have been my cue. They were on vacation. They had muffins. Not everything in a family needed to be shared.Instead, I cajoled, complained, and insisted. Had we traveled all this way to watch TV? Didn&#x2019;t family time always make us happy?After you live with folks for a while, you learn their particular kind of crazy. When Ken and the kids realized I was not going to let this drop, they begrudgingly acquiesced. It took nearly ninety minutes, but eventually, everyone was awake, dressed, and sunscreened for the transcendent family outing I had declared. We set off up the hill.&#xA0;It was strange to be ascending with people so obviously downtrodden.It was hotter now than when I had originally set out. My formerly energetic pace was quickly slackened by grumbles, quarrels, and literal foot-dragging.&#x201C;I&#x2019;m hot.&#x201D;&#x201C;Walking is dumb.&#x201D;&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t believe we&#x2019;re missing &#x2018;Girl Meets World&#x2019; for this.&#x201D;I should have left them at the hotel. What kind of idiot drags kids out of a bathtub to hike? If and when we ever finished this dirty ramble, they were just going to need another bath. I had desperately wanted to share this sojourn with them, and as soon as we began sharing it, I desperately wanted them to go away.The kids made me cranky and I made them crankier, and various threats were lobbed regarding the abandonment of the entire business, but we kept trudging forward anyway&#x2014;me, because I refused to return to the hotel yet again without first climbing this blasted hill, and them, well . . . because they are kids, and kids are prone to follow trails and sidewalks until they end. Shel Silverstein taught us that.What began as a swift, splendid hike by myself turned into a slow, terrible hike with children. But here&#x2019;s the thing, it&#x2019;s actually really hard to stay angry at your kids when:For about eleven minutes, our slog became kind of awesome. We reached the summit. We caught a lizard. We followed a secret path and ate wild fennel. We even made it halfway back to the car before everyone fell apart again. Someone had rocks in her shoe. Someone else was angry about his hat.That&#x2019;s the funny thing about doing anything with kids. It does not matter where we go&#x2014;a restaurant, a water park, the bathroom&#x2014;taking them with us makes the excursion more difficult. It is tempting to avoid outings altogether. That hike was different because our kids were there. It was so much worse but also a little better. I have stood on a mountaintop before. But they never had. I have hiked through blisters and sunburns, discomfort and thirst, and have been rewarded by majesty at the trail&#x2019;s end. But they never had. I have never summited Everest. At the rate my pants are not fitting, it may not ever be in the cards. But I imagine that the only thing greater than climbing a tremendous peak is enabling someone else to climb it with you. The only thing better than a sunset is a sunset that you share. On such journeys, adventure and purpose meet.It can be exhausting to teach our kids adventure, but it is more frustrating still to teach them complacency. I want my kids to comfort the broken, defend the weak, and minister to those in need. These are not always natural acts. They require confidence and bravery. And I dare say they begin with simple steps, even rocky, bedraggled, complaint-riddled steps on a hill overlooking the ocean.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"<strong>What individuals, families, companies and world leaders can learn from Bob Goff&#x2019;s secretly incredible New York Times Best Seller</strong>I first met Bob Goff about seven years ago when he came to the Manor for afternoon tea and a chat. He parked his jacked-up red Jeep Wrangler at a funky angle&#xA0;in my office driveway and leapt out of the driver&#x2019;s seat and into our offices with more energy than a rugby team. Bob oozed more ideas and verve for life in the hour we spent together than anyone I&#x2019;d ever met.&#xA0;He wasn&#x2019;t our typical office visitor. He was not a social entrepreneur or executive in need of a clear strategy, or asking for help to create a new product. Bob just came to share his story, be present in the moment and see where the conversation went.Bob spoke passionately about his faith, fighting bad guys and helping to save children in India and Uganda. He shared stories about whimsical capers, meetings with world leaders, his passion for building schools in developing nations and his utter disregard for the way things <em>should</em> be done<em>.</em> The sheer number of adventures that played out in Bob&#x2019;s life were hard to keep up with, and as I sat there I thought Bob was either one of the most insane or incredible guys I&#x2019;d ever come across. I think it&#x2019;s the latter. Imagine pulling your children out of school for a year and taking them to interviews with major world leaders to understand what leaders care about, in an attempt to show we all care about the same things.By now, you might be wondering what Bob Goff does for a living&#x2014;a high-powered political leader or a selfless humanitarian? Perhaps you already Googled him, and if you did, you found Bob&#x2019;s an average guy who has built a career as an attorney. But that&#x2019;s not the whole story&#x2014;for Bob it&#x2019;s about being secretly incredible and it&#x2019;s not about your day job. It&#x2019;s about how you live every moment of your life, every day. In his fantastically original book, <a href=\"http://bobgoff.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>LOVE DOES</em></a> Bob shares some of the amazing adventures that have unfolded in his life.<em>LOVE DOES</em> is a narrative of stories and ideas directly from Bob&#x2019;s life of&#xA0;pranks and whimsical capers as an international crime fighter, lover of life, man of adventure and father extraordinaire. Bob contends that love is not a passive or theoretical force, but a full contact emotion that can change every facet of your life. He will be the first to tell you that he doesn&#x2019;t have it all together, but can guarantee you that he&#x2019;s an active participant, enjoying the ride every step of the way. Bob brings joy and happiness to those he meets, and his book is overflowing with life and love lessons that are applicable to individuals, families, executives, employees and world leaders. He&#x2019;s a wise, kind, brave, courageous, wild man who writes in a real, whimsical, inspiring, and entertaining style. And like Bob, his book doesn&#x2019;t fit a formula. He&#x2019;s the kind of man other men want to be like, and women want to hug.Bob lives life, rather than talking about it or worrying about it. In every chapter of his book he shares the spontaneous, contagious and authentic power of love in action and the lessons from his incredibly unique life experiences like what he learned from spontaneously picking up the phone and inviting Attorney General Ashcroft to go to Uganda with him, or sitting outside of a dean&#x2019;s office for weeks begging his way into law school. Bob doesn&#x2019;t do the expected; he advocates life like a pickup basketball game. If you&#x2019;ve got a hook shot, bring it. If you&#x2019;re not a good shooter, pass it. Either way, just bring all the game you&#x2019;ve got. And while I won&#x2019;t give away any more of the joy in reading <em>LOVE DOES</em>, I thought I&#x2019;d share my top ten favorite takeaways:1. Your life is not defined by what you believe in, it&#x2019;s about what you actively and deliberately participate in.2. Don&#x2019;t be afraid of failing at things that matter, be afraid of succeeding at things that don&#x2019;t.3. Stop thinking you shape circumstances and start letting them shape you.4. Say yes, and see what happens.5. Words don&#x2019;t just describe who you are, they shape who you are.6. Sharing your life with the right people is really important.7. You can learn as much from a Jeep Wrangler as you can from a teacher, you just need to pay attention.8. It&#x2019;s more important to put your time into doing something, rather than putting it into trying to be someone.9. Religion tastes awful, especially when you eat the fake stuff.10. Don&#x2019;t wait for every door to be opened for you, get ready to kick a few down.This book will inspire you to actively start managing life in a new way. It will make you rethink how you&#x2019;re living. It will make you laugh and maybe even cry. Lay in a hammock, on a beach, next to a river, in the grass, on the porch or on the couch, but make the time to read it.<a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3000393/finding-incredible-experiences-ordinary-life\" target=\"_blank\">Read an excerpt&#xA0;</a>from&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Love-Does-Discover-Secretly-Incredible/dp/1400203759\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Love Does: Discover a Secretly Incredible Life in an Ordinary World</em>.</a><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"When any movement gains momentum for a sustained period of time, the &#x201C;[Insert Movement] is Dead&#x201D; article appears like clockwork. The corporate culture movement is no exception, yet the recent death knell piece in MIT Sloan Management Review, <a href=\"http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-end-of-corporate-culture-as-we-know-it/\"><em>The End of Corporate Culture as We Know It</em></a>, is more perceptive than prophetic because the future is already here.Having worked in the world of culture in various forms &#x2013; leader, builder, guide &#x2013; for the past decade and exposed to a myriad of organizational cultures, I have come to believe we are all striving for the same thing &#x2013; the best way for humans to work together, produce great results and feel good about how it is done.Therefore, most corporate value systems and cultures connect to three things:Organizations&#x2019; values generally ladder up to one of these three categories. We all want teamwork, but call it different things. We all want to make money, but increasingly not at the expense of our humanity and general enjoyment of life. We all want to think our organization is special and unique, but it&#x2019;s really not.Why? Because we are all humans trying our best based on what we know. Some folks have been exposed to work in a way that elevates people and profit. Others have toiled in pure performance cultures, emotion and humanity be damned. We typically learn by what we&#x2019;ve been exposed to, not knowing there is another way.That&#x2019;s not to say all workplaces will look the same, but I think the difference resides more in the people and intentional work around culture than in a specific connection to the outward expression of the brand. At least at first.Perhaps I&#x2019;m just setting a low bar because of the nature of most workplaces and their decided un-humanness. Perhaps organizations need to operate first as a human culture before they can be a distinct culture. And, right now, human is distinct.The data is in on what makes more human cultures &#x2013; connection purpose, genuine relationships, psychological safety, transparency, autonomy in how work is accomplished, clarity of expectations, excelling as a team and opportunities to learn. I&#x2019;m sure there are more pillars I missed, but check out any number of culture measurement tools for the full list. I believe this is what the MIT Sloan article refers to as &#x201C;universal rules of engagement&#x201D;.&#xA0;Beyond human then, what can make an organization unique? It&#x2019;s more degrees on a dial than yes/no levers and it can be dictated by intended outward expression of your brand.The degree to which you are:high-fives only when targets are hit or appreciation for each moment trying to change the worldbuttoned-up and top-down or encouraging everyone&#x2019;s freak flag to flybold steps and looking for what&#x2019;s next or driving efficiency and improving at the marginsa relentless idea and execution machine no matter the hour or allowing for down-time and methodical in decision-making?&#xA0;learn by doing and accepting of failure or conservative and staying the coursedetailed in planning and how to execute at every level or localized opportunity identification and figuring it outEach dial and orientation can either be rooted in humanness or not. And, no organization will be pegged on either side of these dials given the various roles and complexities of business.Cultivating culture in any organization is hard work as it is a challenge to align human beings at scale. After all, the diversity of thought and experience is what the richness of the human experience is about. However, if you want to be unique and benefit from that richness, you should get to human first.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"In college, I got certified to teach middle school, so I spent countless hours with highly inquisitive, often remarkable and occasionally exhausting thirteen-year-olds. One of their favorite questions to ask (like most teenagers) was, &#x201C;Ms. Burke, what&#x2019;s the point of this, anyway?&#x201D;It&#x2019;s easy to dismiss the <em>What&#x2019;s the point?</em> question as symptomatic of teenagers (or millennials, for that matter), but the truth is that all of us look for purpose and reason in what we do every day &#x2013; the eighth graders I taught just happened to be more vocal about it. Recently, when we ran an experiment on our new <a href=\"http://www.hubspot.com/jobs\" target=\"_blank\">HubSpot Jobs page</a> I had a flashback of being in front of the classroom. We embedded <a href=\"https://slack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Slack</a> functionality, allowing candidates to ask our recruiters and hiring managers questions in real-time. Traction on the Slack channel varied widely, leading the team experimenting with it to ask, &#x201C;What&#x2019;s the point of this? Is it worth it?&#x201D;This simple conversation made me realize I had failed the team as a manager&#x2013;I had given them the autonomy to experiment but not the rationale to understand what success or failure meant for our company, our team, our learnings and our ability to grow as a team. It was a good reminder to me of three key reasons why <em>what&#x2019;s the point</em> matters.<strong>1.&#xA0;Employees will be more engaged: </strong>Data shows that <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/280720\" target=\"_blank\">73% of purpose-oriented employees </a>are likely to stay at their companies for three years or more. But well beyond the data, the best employees want to feel like a meaningful part of the work they do and own the outcomes associated with it. Giving them broader context on why it matters, how to think about success, and what outcomes any given project will drive for the company, customers, or candidates goes a long way. Talented employees on any team have a myriad of options for what they do and where they work, so give them a compelling mission-driven project to work on, meaningful purpose behind their daily tasks, and as much transparency as possible to help them learn and grow.<strong>2. The output will be better: </strong>If you, as an employee, don&#x2019;t know the point of a given exercise or task you&#x2019;ll only do what&#x2019;s asked of you. But if you understand the meaning and context behind what you&#x2019;re doing, you&#x2019;ll feel the autonomy and imperative to think outside the box and get creative. In the Slack example, it was easy to look at a snapshot of a week&#x2019;s time and think the experiment didn&#x2019;t work, but once our culture and recruiting teams had more context around the &#x201C;why&#x201D; of the experiment, they came up with even better ideas than the initial scope of the project, including recruiting Q&amp;As and Ask Me Anything sessions with employees&#x2013;both of which created impact and results for the company above and beyond what we had initially anticipated.<strong>3. Prioritization will be more effective: </strong>As a leader it&#x2019;s easy to get into the rush of the daily grind. Overwhelmed by volume, fatigue and everything in between, it&#x2019;s easy to start asking your team or your colleagues to work on projects just to get them off the collective checklist; that&#x2019;s not good for your business or your team. Forcing yourself to understand the purpose of a project and explain (even informally) how it fits into your team or company goals ensures that you&#x2019;re prioritizing what&#x2019;s truly important for the business versus being reactive based on requests or demands. That&#x2019;s good news for everyone involved, from shareholders to employees to colleagues and fellow leaders.Jack Welch, management guru, former GE Executive, author, and my former professor at MIT once said, &#x201C;any company trying to compete must engage the mind of every employee.&#x201D; He&#x2019;s right&#x2013;you need to win the hearts and minds of your employees, not just with your high level vision, but with an understanding of the purpose and intent you put behind every key initiative. Management initiatives often focus on the who, the what, and the how as our natural inclination as businesses grow and scale. But the <em>why</em> really makes a massive difference, both in the ownership and accountability employees feel and in their overall job happiness and satisfaction.&#x201C;What&#x2019;s the point?&#x201D; gets a bad wrap as a question. It&#x2019;s often considered a bratty or annoying push on behalf of young employees. But the truth is that humans are inherently purpose-driven, and just because you or your team are busy doesn&#x2019;t mean you should skip giving people context on the reasoning, logic and purpose behind the tasks you&#x2019;re sending their way. Doing purpose-driven work is more interesting, more dynamic and more fun for everyone involved, including managers and executives. And if it doesn&#x2019;t fit those criteria, what&#x2019;s the point, anyway?<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"<em>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s the way it&#x2019;s always been done here.&#x201D;</em>Those are the words that grate on my soul. In a meeting I was in recently I felt the internal nudge to challenge the way a volunteer committee was moving to bring a new person into the organization. The current employees hadn&#x2019;t been given an opportunity to speak into the position description, the talent needs of their team, or the timeline. In fact, their suggestions were ignored or dismissed quickly with &#x201C;we got this&#x201D;.As an outsider sitting in on this meeting I asked some obvious &#x201C;Why?&#x201D; questions. Why didn&#x2019;t you give the team a chance to shape the process? Why didn&#x2019;t you introduce the candidate to anyone on the team before an offer was made? Why are you choosing someone who the current team unanimously doubts their skills can fulfill future needs?The answer: <em>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s the way it&#x2019;s always been done here.&#x201D;</em>Whoever was quoted saying, <em>&#x201C;In the end, common sense and justice will prevail&#x201D;</em> never spent time working inside a bureaucratic organization. Because rarely does common sense shape how things are done. In fact, as I&#x2019;ve been reflecting on that meeting, it&#x2019;s clear to me that there&#x2019;s a big difference between common sense and nonsense.Common sense would say that people in an organization should be extended trust and an opportunity to offer input into processes and decisions.Common sense would suggest that new and innovative ways of doing things are just around the corner, and there are simpler ways to solve problems.Common sense would guide organizations to carve out new, original and unique ways of managing its resources to accomplish its goals.Common sense organizations develop their people, unleash talent and manage resources effectively around a clear, compelling vision.Too often, nonsense prevails. People repeat the way decisions have always been made. Teams neglect to challenge old ways of thinking and continue down the same path. Organizations forget the management mantra: &#x201C;<em>What got you hear won&#x2019;t get you there.&#x201D;&#xA0;</em>Left alone, organizations will work tremendously hard to maintain the status quo. The walls of fear and comfort are both thick and high. Decisions are justified and conversations are closed. And as such, the potential of the employees and resources are wasted. It&#x2019;s nonsense!Here are a few UNCOMMON SENSE ways to spot nonsense in your organization:Wouldn&#x2019;t it be interesting to design an organization that is truly shaped by common sense? An organization where all decisions, systems, and strategies are filtered through questions like: Is this really the best way to do it? Are there any other people or teams that would benefit from giving input on this? Have we really listened to, and understood, the needs and problems of our customers? Does this align or conflict with our vision, mission and values? If we do this, what are the unintended consequences?If you follow the path of common sense, you might find yourself alone. You might not be able to find a lot of other companies who do things the way you do them. You might feel strange, risky, and unconventional. Good! The problems in our world require fresh thinking, new ways of approaching them, and adaptable organizations ready to carve out original paths.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Anyone who has ever attempted to lead change in an organization, regardless of its size and complexity, will attest that it&#x2019;s not for the faint of heart. One simple attestation to this is the countless number of books and articles written on the topic.<br><br>While organizational change can be difficult, regardless of the circumstances, it can be particularly challenging to create change in organizations that have longstanding histories and deeply embedded cultural norms, beliefs, and assumptions. Organizations that are solidly grounded in legacy and that place significant value on an enviable history oftentimes have the most difficulty creating change. This is especially true when these organizations are attempting to create transformative change (completely disruptive) as opposed to evolutionary change (small slices of change over time).<strong><u>Why is this? </u></strong>Organizations with deeply engrained beliefs about how business should be conducted have likely developed these beliefs based on many years of success using those methods. In these situations, it in not difficult to see that asking people to do things different may generate levels of dissonance, anxiety, and discomfort that affecting disruptive change may present a rather significant challenge.Any real or potential change creates the potential for people to lose power or control of their environment. This, not surprisingly, can create anxiety and resistance.Asking people who have done things for a certain way for a very long time to do things differently can create anxiety. &#x201C;I have mastered my job despite any frustrations I may have with process. If you expect me to do things differently, I may not know how to be successful.&#x201D;Employees having longer tenures in such organizations, can adopt deep personal and psychological connects to the legacy of their employer, making any suggestion of change an affront to their own identities. &#x201C;Suggesting that we need to change means that I have been doing something wrong this whole time.&#x201D;Finally, in the absence of factual information, people tend to fill in the gaps and this is rarely helpful or a fully accurate representation of reality as it tends to be laden with peoples&#x2019; deep-rooted fears and anxieties about the situation.What can you do to help facilitate change in these types of environments?In a world where technological advancements are causing massive disruption in every corner of our lives, those organizations that have long relied on operating in a certain way are faced with the overwhelming task of creating disruptive change. If they fail to adapt, or do so too slowly, they run the very real risk of becoming irrelevant. While it is widely accepted that organizational culture is a key aspect of performance, many leaders fail to clearly grasp how to sustainably evolve the cultures of their organizations with the speed and agility required to keep up with changing realities in the markets. One way to do this is to develop the agility muscles in the organization early so that when it is time to adapt to significant changes, it can be done in a more thoughtful and intentional manner.<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/chriscancialosi/2019/01/18/navigating-change-in-deeply-rooted-organizations/#25a170e64cdb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Original post</a>.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"I met three incredible young men named Jason Russell, Laren Poole, and Bobby Bailey almost seven years ago. Just out of college, they had decided to use their newly acquired filmmaking talents to go to the Sudan and document the atrocities of a distant war. What they weren&#x2019;t expecting was to get there, find the war to be over, and end up uncovering child abuse, abduction, murder, rape and torture in Uganda.When they returned, Jason was incensed, frustrated and angry, and told me about their plans to use storytelling to save the lives of children who are suffering at the hands of a man known as Joseph Kony. Nearly a decade later, Jason&#x2019;s dedication, passion, creativity, drive and intentions haven&#x2019;t wavered. The motives and focus of <a href=\"http://www.invisiblechildren.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Invisible Children</a> are exactly the same as they were in 2006: to end the abduction and abuse of children in Uganda. He and his movement of passionate and engaged followers have created what CBS News is calling &#x201C;the most successful viral campaign ever&#x201D; through their <a href=\"http://www.kony2012.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Kony 2012 campaign</a>.I have been absolutely amazed by their consistent commitment, conviction and creativity to craft and use the power of a compelling story. How they&#x2019;ve told the story, and where, has changed thousands of lives in both the U.S. and Uganda. High school and college students have been engaged in social justice. Invisible Children has elevated the power of storytelling and program engagement. They created a movement of people who didn&#x2019;t just give money they gave their time, they took a stand, camped out, and marched on Washington. Over time, they have changed the lives of the participants in their stories and their campaigns, and also changed the way many other not-for-profits tell their stories.This week something even bigger happened. The storytellers at Invisible Children inspired the country to have a connected conversation about something of real substance. For the past week, the focus transitioned from the latest &#x201C;Sh*t People Say&#x201D; videos, Kim Kardashian&#x2019;s newest relationship, and Lindsay Lohan&#x2019;s latest comeback stunt to these children in Uganda. It&#x2019;s got people everywhere thinking about communities, and people on the other side of the world they have never met. This story has got kids, &#xA0;teachers, parents and peers talking to each other about an issue with substance and groups mobilizing to join the story and change the lives of the abused children in Uganda. The lesson here is not in social media, but in the power of the story and the hope that lies in human good. These three young men decided they needed to do something about a problem, and, almost 10 years later, the world at large is finally hearing the story loud and clear. This week, Invisible Children gave our country something compelling to watch and a call to action.Imagine if this happened with other issues we have in this world? Imagine if we partnered with the people on the ground in Iran and told their story? Imagine if we told the Palestinian and Israeli story differently?Countless college classrooms and business publications will undoubtedly analyze Invisible Children&#x2019;s Kony 2012 video, breaking it down to be studied in its parts. The power of social media is undeniable, and while the real fascination here might be the speed, scale, and size of participation, I&#x2019;d like to suggest this is really about the story and how it has been told. This three-act construct is clear; there&#x2019;s a villain, a problem, and a hero. And as this well-told story continues to unfold, we are nearing the final chapter. Here are some valuable takeaways from this game-changing story I gathered through recent meetings with Jason, and a chat I had with Scot Chisholm, CEO of <a href=\"http://www.stayclassy.org/\" target=\"_blank\">StayClassy</a>, the online fundraising platform that powers Invisible Children&#x2019;s fundraising campaigns:<strong>1. With a compelling story, hearts and minds are moved.<br> </strong>Joseph Kony&#x2019;s LRA had been waging war against the Ugandan government and raping and plundering the villages of Northern Uganda for many years before Invisible Children arrived, and, despite the UN being deeply involved, the world at large had no idea this war was being waged on these children. Jason, Laren, and Bobby became engaged in the tragedy because they could see themselves in the faces of these Ugandan children living in fear of their lives. As a result they made a personal commitment to the children of Gulu to tell their story.Flash forward to this week and their promise has come true in the form of their video reaching more than 70 million computer screens and every broadcast media outlet in the country. Social media&#x2019;s time is definitely now, but it was making the story relatable that drove this level of viral success. I wonder how many people put themselves in Jason&#x2019;s place as he attempted to explain the story of Jacob and these atrocities to his own son, or how many thought of a friend in need as the story of Jason and Jacob&#x2019;s friendship unfolded, or how many clicked the &#x201C;donate&#x201D; button as Jacob shed tears on their screen.These creative activists have been on the forefront of developing and discovering what Jason calls 4D story-telling for the past five years. In their unfolding quest to end a war on children in Uganda, they&#x2019;ve inspired, engaged, and empowered millions of people to become part of a movement of storytellers and social activists who have raised millions of dollars in the process.<strong>2. Without conviction, nothing is ventured and nothing is gained.<br> </strong>Invisible Children&#x2019;s conviction and commitment to this story and this issue has been unwavering for nearly a decade. This week, it&#x2019;s landed them in conversations with Piers Morgan, <em>The Today Show</em> and Anderson Cooper. But it hasn&#x2019;t been an easy ride. They&#x2019;ve experienced a roller coaster of emotional ups and downs and have been told &#x201C;no&#x201D; more times than they&#x2019;d probably like to remember. They&#x2019;ve risked their lives in dangerous conditions abroad, sacrificed their personal time in pursuit of the greater good, and they&#x2019;ve given up a large part of their own lives to save the lives of others.Perhaps the greatest reward is witnessed by the growth of Jacob through his friendship with Jason. In their first video, Jacob cries as he tells Jason he would rather die than continue to live in the conditions he is currently forced to live under. Jason made a promise to Jacob that day that he has risked nearly everything to bring to fruition. That promise saved, and changed, a life. Today, Jacob is a happy 21-year-old studying law in Kampala, Uganda.<strong>3. Purpose-driven passion is infectious.<br> </strong>The team at Invisible Children set out seven years ago to give a voice to thousands of children who didn&#x2019;t have one. They released their first video and quickly began touring college campuses and launching unique guerilla campaigns that targeted the youth in this country. Each year, they have made a commitment to build upon the last, with storytelling always at their core.They are on the front lines of social justice and they are creating new ways to raise awareness and affect change. Their focus on the issue and the way in which they have conducted themselves has created a powerful Millenial-lead movement. Their model of multi-dimensional storytelling allows people to engage in the issue through a connected campaign of digital media, social events, film, and a tiered approach to giving and advocacy that has inspired a tidal wave of engagement.Scot Chisholm explained the impact this has had directly on their fundraising efforts: &#x201C;We have found that people connect to a cause based on a combination of factors, and campaigns like Kony 2012 that effectively harness both the emotions stirred by the problem you&#x2019;re addressing and your organization&#x2019;s own passion to do the work have the greatest chance of success.&#x201D;<strong>4. There is no substitute for commitment and fortitude.<br> </strong>When the founding team from Invisible Children returned to the U.S. from their first trip to Uganda, they made a short documentary of their discovery and their commitment to end the war. Today the mission is the same as it was back then. For years, they&#x2019;ve toured the country visiting hundreds of school campuses, packing gyms, sharing their story with anyone who would listen, inviting people of all ages to engage and connect with the plight of the children in Uganda through their story. They gave out their DVD, raised money and awareness, and invited the kids on campus to hold parties to share the documentary, becoming part of the story and the solution.They have been committed to this movement for more than seven years. The Invisible Children team have rolled up their sleeves, shown commitment over time and changed lives both here and in Uganda. They have highlighted an area of the world and its atrocities so history will not look back and say, &#x201C;Why was this ignored?&#x201D; or &#x201C;Why didn&#x2019;t people get involved?&#x201D;&#x201C;It may have appeared this way, but this campaign did not happen overnight. Invisible Children has been steadily building awareness around this cause for years. Without their prior efforts, and the following they&#x2019;ve been able to build, it&#x2019;s unlikely that they would have been able to produce such a dramatic viral effect with Kony 2012,&#x201D; Scot shared.<strong>5. Make it compelling and easy for others to get involved.</strong><br> Invisible Children meticulously examined their audiences and thought through the different ways that those audiences would be compelled to get involved. Then, they made it easy on them to participate. Have $30 to spare? Buy a Kony 2012 kit. Have more? Pledge a monthly donation. Broke college student without a dollar to your name? Send a tweet to Angelina Jolie or offer your time to hang posters on April 20th.&#x201C;For campaigns that aim to empower supporters to take a direct action, it&#x2019;s vital for the organization to gain an understanding of what motivates their target audience,&#x201D; says&#xA0;Chisholm. &#x201C;Each new campaign will shed new light on the behaviors of the organization&#x2019;s audience; the successful organizations, like Invisible Children, learn from what they see, and continue to optimize their messaging for each subsequent campaign. Invisible Children is also good at creating clear calls-to-action so that their supporters understand what they can do next to help advance the mission. It is also critical to convey how a single person&#x2019;s contribution, whether large or small, can help move the needle. The power in numbers concept is something that Invisible Children has practically written the book on.&#x201D;<strong>6. The road to good intentions is now full of people who are involved and active.<br> </strong>Far too often, great intentions are met with unfounded backlash and the truth diluted by false accusations. But whether you&#x2019;re a foreign policy expert, a member of the media, a professor, or an average Joe trying to critique these guys, guess what? They changed the conversation this week. And they have also changed lives. They have impacted communities in Uganda and the U.S., as well as many new social justice-focused organizations and NGOs doing amazing work all over the world.Today, you have to ask yourself which side of history you want to be on: for the kids, or not. And if you want to be a critic, have the courage to share your own positive contributions to a cause for good. Why don&#x2019;t we put an end to negative hearsay, stop with the gossip, and focus on the facts: there are children&#x2019;s lives at stake here.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"I recently sat down with Shaney Jo Darden, the woman who has prominently displayed the phrase, &#x201C;I Love Boobies!&#x201D; across everything from bracelets to t-shirts in her endeavor to help eradicate breast cancer. Her company, <a href=\"http://www.keep-a-breast.org\" target=\"_blank\">The Keep A Breast Foundation</a>, works to use art events, educational programs and fundraising efforts to increase breast cancer awareness among young people by exposing them to methods of prevention, early detection and support so that they are better equipped to make choices and develop habits that will benefit their long-term health and well-being.On the eve of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, I was inspired to take an inside look at Shaney Jo&#x2019;s unconventionally effective methods for motivating our youth to care about their health.<strong>Why are your boobies everywhere?<br></strong>We&#x2019;ve seen such amazing support from people all across the globe that really want to support a prevention-based breast cancer campaign.&#xA0;I think many people appreciate our approach, being focused on teens, and reaching them through art, music and fashion. The <em>I Love Boobies</em> campaign has helped extend our reach to people across the globe, resonating with the language we use and the information we give them.<strong>Why breast cancer?<br></strong>Keep A Breast started over 10 years ago after discovering there was a need to educate and inspire a younger generation about breast cancer prevention. I&#x2019;ve had several people in my life, and in my community, that were struggling with the disease and I felt there was nothing for my generation to feel connected to. I knew I needed to do something that really resonated with myself and my friends. The first Breast Cast exhibition was born and has continued to grow from there.<strong>What&#x2019;s your end goal with Keep A Breast?<br></strong>To eradicate breast cancer and stop the suffering and deaths that it creates. We want to educate people about breast cancer and make a positive change in their lives to radically reduce everyone&#x2019;s risk.<strong>Where did the ideas for the bracelets come from?<br></strong>We saw a need for people to support charities they were passionate about with an everyday item, we had been using the <em>I Love Boobies </em>campaign on t-shirts, and when the LIVESTRONG bracelets started becoming popular we decided it was the perfect fit. Since the <em>I Love Boobies</em> campaign was really resonating with people we saw it natural to be on the bracelet as well.<strong>Where did the idea for the casts come from?<br></strong>When I decided to do a breast cancer fundraiser I wanted to design something that I knew how to do &#x2013; throw memorable art events. My background is in art and fashion design so the idea just came naturally.<strong>What are some of the most moving stories you&#x2019;ve heard along your mission?<br></strong>I hear moving stories every day. It&#x2019;s challenging to be present and to hear each story with a clear and open heart. All of the stories I hear are moving in their own way. I love to hear stories about &#xA0;our ablility to support entire families that are going through the diagnosis of a loved one, just as much as I love the story about helping one person. I think the stories that I connect with the most are from the young survivors that we cast. Casting the breasts or non-breasts of these women is a very intimate, personal and vulnerable experience. I honor that they trust me and are able&#xA0;to bear all for me. I love to see their faces when we are done, and the overwhelming feeling that I&#x2019;ve given them something that has helped them through their breast cancer journey in some way.<strong>What is your motivation for opening a non-profit?<br></strong>The motivation came from the people, Keep A Breast was inteded to be a single event 11 years ago, however, people&#x2019;s interest has kept it going year after year. Keep A Breast grew all on its own with the support of the community of artists and activists that created it. The need for more information is the motivation.<strong>What is the most innovative thing you have ever done?<br></strong>Everything has been done&#x2014;I have not had any new ideas. &#x201C;Boobies&#x201D; have always been around and they have always been loved. The innovation is our approach. I look at everything we do, and I automatically research to see what&#x2019;s been done before. I drive my team crazy sometimes, because I turn everything that exists inside out, and I&#x2019;m not afraid to question the status quo and stick my neck out for my beliefs. We innovate in our unique approach to educate teens using their voices through avenues they are passionate about.<strong>What is the biggest impact you have made?<br></strong>The biggest impact comes from the testimonials we have from young people across the globe. Whether it be an email saying they were able to talk about a family member&#x2019;s diagnosis, or that they found a lump early, or found an ally in their personal struggle with breast cancer through Keep A Breast. Each testimonial is what gets me out of bed in the morning.<strong>How do you measure your impact?<br></strong>We have been working on a research study on the youth perceptions of breast cancer that we will publish this year. I&#x2019;m excited to share this information with the world and I hope that other organizations, corporations, and the medical community will be able to use the data to help address the needs of young people affected by breast cancer. I also know that I have touched the lives of millions of teens through our events, traveling education booth and our cause merchandise. The generation of teens right now is extremely more informed about breast cancer than any other generation before them with information that will save their lives.<strong>What are you passionate about?<br></strong>I&#x2019;m most passionate about truth and fairness. I believe everyone has the right to eat healthy food free of pesticides, hormones, and chemicals. I believe that products on our grocers&#x2019; shelves should have higher standards and should be safe to use in our homes and on our bodies. It&#x2019;s not fair that we are plagued by disease because our government does not protect us. However, I believe that true love always prevails.<strong>What values do you live by?<br></strong>My core values are family, friends and living my truth. I learn a lot from my mom and I&#x2019;m inspired by her mantra, &#x201C;come from love&#x201D;. I try my best to always come from a place of love with everything I do. I&#x2019;m not perfect, and I stress out because I have so much responsibility in this world to all the people around me and to the public in general. I&#x2019;ve chosen this path that some think is crazy, but I know I have the full support of so many people and the universe to succeed in my mission. My mom&#x2019;s other mantra is &#x201C;choose love over fear&#x201D;. I live by this because I would always rather make a choice from love and get hurt and learn a hard lesson than to not have made that choice in the first place.<strong>What is the best advice you&#x2019;ve been given?<br></strong>Nothing groundbreaking&#x2014;the usual stuff. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not about you&#x201D; and &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t take it personal.&#x201D; Keep A Breast is known globally as the largest youth-based breast cancer prevention organization. I have had to put myself out there publicly, for all to judge. Some people consider Keep A Breast to be controversial&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve received hate mail. I can&#x2019;t say it didn&#x2019;t hurt or make me question what the hell I&#x2019;m doing, but I am surrounded by good people, reminding me to follow my heart and stick to my guns.<strong>What is the best advice you have ever given?<br></strong>I usually stray away from giving advice. I like to help people come to their own conclusions so they end up taking their own advice.<strong>What advice would you give corporations who want to get involved with a cause?<br></strong>Do it for the right reasons, and be authentic about it. Email me.<strong>What rules or principles run, lead and inspire Keep A Breast?<br></strong>Making sure I am still able to live a balanced life full of yoga, shoe sales and lunch breaks with my dog Camper. Although a day is never the same between casting young survivors in the &#x201C;Treasured Chest Program&#x201D;, to traveling across the globe with our &#x201C;Traveling Education Booth&#x201D;, or developing the ever expanding Keep A Breast Foundation&#x2019;s line of cause merchandise that allows young people to give back. We do keep it balanced with our &#x201C;Let My People Love Their Life&#x201D; policy, which&#xA0;allows each employee a flexible work schedule, as long as their work gets done with no negative impact to others. This policy is intended for events and circumstances that will increase the richness and quality of their lives.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"There is a lot of talk these days about &#x2018;experience&#x2019; and its role in <a href=\"https://www.fastcodesign.com/90124930/why-experience-design-matters-more-than-ever-before?utm_content=buffer9563b&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\">design</a> and <a href=\"http://www.xthebook.com/\">business</a>. Whether it&#x2019;s applied to <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2017/04/simple-smart-elegant-yes-elegant-glucose-monitor/\">user experience</a>, <a href=\"https://hbr.org/webinar/2017/03/the-future-of-the-customer-experience\">customer experience</a> or the <a href=\"https://thefutureorganization.com/employee-experience-research/\">employee experience</a>, there is a growing desire by brands to create remarkable customer interactions which are memorable and inspiring.<strong>Remember the Welcome to the Experience Economy?<br></strong>This topic of experience, however, is not a new one. As a formal idea, it was introduced almost twenty years ago. In 1998, <a href=\"http://www.strategichorizons.com/pineandgilmore/joepine/\">B. Joseph Pine II</a> and <a href=\"http://www.strategichorizons.com/pineandgilmore/jimgilmore/\">James H. Gilmore</a> wrote a <a href=\"https://hbr.org/\">Harvard Business Review</a> article called, <a href=\"https://hbr.org/1998/07/welcome-to-the-experience-economy\">&#x201C;Welcome to the Experience Economy&#x201D;</a> which was followed by a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Experience-Economy-Updated-Joseph-Pine/dp/1422161978?ie=UTF8&amp;redirect=true&amp;tag=wwwstrategich-20\">book</a> in 1999.They described the concept of the Experience Economy by outlining The Progression of Economic Value. This principle describes how the values by which consumers base their purchases have evolved or progressed over the last century. Let&#x2019;s use a cake to describe the idea;An early pioneer of the experience economy was <a href=\"http://www.justdisney.com/walt_disney/biography/long_bio.html\">Walt Disney</a>, a man before his time. While his early storytelling success was based on being a cartoonist and then as animated film visionary, he soon grew weary of two-dimensional stories that could only be observed from a screen.He began to imagine a <a href=\"https://woub.org/2015/09/09/american-experience-walt-disney/\">three-dimensional, story-driven experience</a> in which the audience members could be transformed into guests or even participants. The question became, &#x201C;What would it look like to create stories in which the guests could interact with the characters and the environments?&#x201D; The answer was the development of Disneyland, The Happiest Place on Earth.The Be Our Guest anthem has become the cornerstone of Disney&#x2019;s experience-based approach. They understand that every guest touchpoint must be as intentional as if it were a scene in a film. From the user experience of the website, the customer experience of ticket purchase, the parking of a car, the walk/ride to the gates, the walk down Main Street, the interaction with the characters, the first view of the castle&#x2026; you get the picture. Every interaction is strategic, designed and layered with backstory.In fact, the Disney story and experience-driven legacy inspired and informed the development of our ideology and methodology at <a href=\"http://www.visioneeringstudios.com/\">Visioneering Studios</a> to create stories through spaces. Our principals, current and past, were trained at <a href=\"https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/\">The Walt Disney Company</a>, <a href=\"https://disneyimaginations.com/about-imaginations/about-imagineering/\">Walt Disney Imagineering</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.aecom.com/\">AECOM</a>, a significant Disney consultant.<strong>The Upside and Dark Side to Experience-Driven Design<br></strong>People are willing to pay for experiences because they offer a benefit and stimulation. People also base the value of experiences on their ability to cause them to tell stories about them. Lastly, people like experiences because they put the individual consumer, the &#x201C;Me&#x201D;, the &#x201C;I&#x201D;, at the center of the attention. It&#x2019;s like pulling up a chair at a table and being served a feast.&#xA0;But, the consumption aspect of experience is part of the problem. This is the dark side of experiences. Even experiences can become commoditized. Most experiences are remarkable, but only for the space of time in which they are being experienced. When an experience is consumer-based, it&#x2019;s based on consumption. You are no longer impacted when you are no longer consuming it. It&#x2019;s like food with empty calories, you know that Snickers bar that is delicious in the moment, but fleeting in its impact.It&#x2019;s time to move beyond a consumer-based approach to experiences. It&#x2019;s time to move beyond the experience economy. In the words of a Christian songwriter, Lanny Wolfe, &#x201C;<em>I&#x2019;m so&#xA0;tired of being stirred but not being changed.&#x201D; </em>So, what&#x2019;s the answer?<strong>Welcome to the Transformation Economy<br></strong>Even Pine and Gilmore predicted that the next era would be the Transformation Economy in which the Yodas of the world will guide aspirants through experiences which result in sustained change in their lives. People are willing to pay for experiences that have the potential to change the way they live, work and play.In fact, there is evidence that this&#xA0;transition is already happening in culture. Through the advances made by technology, it is widely acknowledged that <a href=\"http://www.pennlive.com/opinion/2013/10/technology_was_supposed_to_connect_us_but_were_more_disconnected_than_ever_rogette_harris.html\">we are more globally connected, yet more locally disconnected</a>. People are looking for deeper reasons to connect.Angie Thurston and Casper ter Kuile of the <a href=\"https://hds.harvard.edu/\">Harvard Divinity School</a> released a study called How We Gather. They were interested in understanding why Millennials specifically are moving away from church attendance. The research uncovered six themes: the desire for community, personal transformation, social transformation, purpose-finding, creativity and accountability. The argument is made that the Church is not providing strong enough alternatives in these areas of life so Millennials are in search of other communities that provide this.One of the ten case studies cited as emerging communities is Crossfit. In fact, there is a growing idea of &#x2018;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/9oc8ZRKDCyU\">Crossfit as Church&#x2019;</a>. Crossfit provides a sense of community where the &#x201C;Me&#x201D; of the experience economy transitions to the &#x201C;We&#x201D; of the transformation economy. In addition to community, Crossfit is a place to undergo personal transformation and accountability. It is very common for a crossfitter to be called to explain why they missed a workout.With this in mind, we are proposing a transformation-experience approach. How can we to reimagine the future of spaces in which we gather; where we live, work and play. This is the future.<strong>The&#xA0;Architecture of Transformative&#xA0;Experience <br></strong>The future of design is transformational experiences. I say <em>future </em>because I believe that strategic design&#xA0;anticipates where our future is headed. And <em>design </em>because I believe that design is the process of envisioning and creating an experience that transforms. I say <em>experience </em>because&#x2026;&#xA0;The challenge becomes how to create spaces that elicits emotional, holistic and transformative experiences?<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"<strong>America has a culture problem: it is seriously out of shape and overconsumes many of the wrong foods.</strong><br><br>An unhealthy corporate culture is like an unhealthy out of shape individual, oftentimes it&#x2019;s overweight, cumbersome and burdened with a number of self-destructive habits. Recognizing that you need to get your culture into optimum health is one of the most important responsibilities an executive team has today&#x2014;and is one that many seem to wrestle with. For most individuals, getting into great shape can be incredibly hard because it&#x2019;s a balancing act of diet and exercise, mind and body, and time and commitment. Too much of one item without a careful balance of the others will deliver unsustainable results, which leads to frustration and a return to old habits. Losing weight, building muscle and getting fit is a constant battle for most people. And, for many it&#x2019;s riddled with everyday excuses. Companies often struggle with their health and fitness in the same way as people.<br><br><strong>Recognize You Have A Health Problem</strong><br>Your products, technologies and services can always be replicated or out-designed, but the unique spirit, energy and engagement of your people cannot be easily copied. Understanding the power that resides in unlocking the full potential of your people is one of the most significant opportunities a company has today. Regularly measuring the health and state of your culture is the first step. However, culture is dismissed in many companies as purely the responsibility of the Human Resources department, and because employee engagement surveys may have high scores, culture is rarely given further consideration. Recognizing the importance culture plays in both short- and long-term success, and understanding that it is a key driver to fuel performance and competitive differentiation, is every executive&#x2019;s responsibility, no matter their function with the company.<br><br>Your culture is a key indicator of the health of your organization and a significant contributor to delivering sustainable, superior results. And while the alarm gets raised by the head of HR when there&#x2019;s an issue, if the CEO is not actively engaged in championing cultural health and transformation, then the problem won&#x2019;t be fixed or opportunities maximized.<br><br><strong>Get Your Culture On The Right Diet</strong> <br>Like the right diet, strategy affects energy, daily performance, how we feel about ourselves, and how we interact with others. We know that to be healthy, we need to eat a well balanced diet. For example, a meat-only diet is obviously unhealthy, and a strategy too heavily focused and driven by one discipline, like finance, will deliver unhealthy results. Strategies that are ill-defined, unbalanced, and unclear will deliver results well short of your organization&#x2019;s best. It&#x2019;s important to ensure that, like a good diet, your strategy is well planned, clearly communicated, embraced, and activated by the people who are responsible for its execution.<br><br><strong>A Healthy Culture Gets The Right Workout</strong><br>Obesity is our nation&#x2019;s #1 healthcare problem and we need to cut the fat with a sense of urgency. As an individual, regardless of whether you&#x2019;re in great shape inevitably someone else&#x2019;s poor health will impact your healthcare costs and the state of all the other stakeholders in the system. The same thing happens in companies: &#x201C;your&#x201D; department is doing what it needs to do and is making a difference, but &#x201C;that&#x201D; department is not strategically following the program and is negatively impacting the entire company&#x2019;s performance. If strategy is like a diet, then culture is like exercise, and both need serious, consistent commitment. No one can exercise for you and there is no quick fix&#x2014;you have to plan the exercise regimen and do the work. As individuals, we often lack discipline and focus, and despite buying equipment, DVD&#x2019;s and memberships, or having Town Hall meetings and strategic frameworks we more often than not fail to use or follow them consistently, and as a result fall short.<br><br>Give Your Culture A Total Commitment<br>Why is it that if we pay a personal trainer to make us do what we could do for free, we actually do it? The accountability, consequences, encouragement and measurement are all drivers that motivate people to maintain their fitness regimen. Establishing the same commitment and accountability, with clear drivers and a fitness regimen for your company culture is essential for sustainable and repeatable success. The danger of doing the same exercises day in and day out is that we plateau and lose commitment. Muscle memory, boredom and fatigue creep into the daily regimen and results cease&#x2014;and companies plateau in the same way. They lose sight of their goals and competitive focus, and poor accountability and pride creep into the culture, creating a false sense of security. A healthy culture engages and activates your people to drive toward your goals and objectives, and it informs you how hard, and in what areas, your organization is pursuing its goals. Strategy guides the way but it&#x2019;s not the motivator; a clearly defined purpose that inspires, engages and activates your people is the best motivator.<br><br><strong>5 Uncommon Sense Approaches to Give Your Culture a Good Workout</strong><br><br><strong>1. Start with the head</strong><br>Plan with the head and play with heart; the leader of the company must go first and stay engaged.<br><br><strong>2. Set definitive goals</strong><br>Be clear about how much you want to gain or lose, and by when. But most importantly, define what success looks likes.<br><br><strong>3. Look in the mirror</strong><br>Companies with high integrity are able to look at themselves honestly and make the correct adjustments to achieve success.<br><br><strong>4. Cut the fat</strong> <br>Eliminate the counter culture detractors and celebrate the contributors; leaders contribute more than just their technical expertise.<br><br><strong>5. Rest</strong> <br>Investigate the causes of fatigue and fading interest, and take a breather. Just as in exercising, lack of rest causes your muscles to breakdown and increases your risk of injury instead of maximizing and achieving results.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span><em>Photo: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/michaeltflickrpics/32175260/sizes/o/in/photostream/\" target=\"_blank\">mst7022</a></em>"

       "content_body":"On June 16, 2016, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bradgobright/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Brad Gobright</a> stood on the summit of Yosemite&#x2019;s iconic 3,000-foot El Capitan&#x2026;for the third time in less than 24 hours. If &#x2013; as many say -- Yosemite is the cathedral of rock climbing then El Cap is its massive and imposing altar.Gobright and his climbing partner, Scott Bennett, accomplished the feat by scaling three different routes in succession: Zodiac, The Nose, and Lurking Fear. Climbing (and descending) thousands of vertical feet requires incredible technical skill, fitness, ability to focus for long periods, mental strength, months of preparation&#x2026;and flashlights.The pair began climbing the first route, Zodiac, around 2pm, topped out, and then arrived back at the bottom around 10pm. Just in time to start another route that goes right up the middle of El Cap, called The Nose. Climbing can be an intimidating adventure in the best conditions so what&#x2019;s it like in the dark? &#x201C;It&#x2019;s pretty cool,&#x201D; Gobright said. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re really just looking at stuff five feet in front of you that gets lit by your headlamp. It&#x2019;s kind of the same focus as during the day but with different light.&#x201D; For many climbing El Cap, a trip takes days and so Gobright and Bennett passed some sleeping climbers on the route. &#x201C;They were pretty surprised to see us going by.&#x201D;They finished the third route after a 23 hour marathon on the granite. Only two other climbing pairs had ever linked three routes on El Cap in 24 hours. A big deal, absolutely. A big party after, well no. &#x201C;By the time we finished, I&#x2019;d been awake for 37 hours so we didn&#x2019;t have much of a celebration.&#x201D;Gobright started climbing at a rock gym in Orange County, California. &#x201C;I was 7 or 8 and my parents would take me and belay but they weren&#x2019;t climbers.&#x201D; Turns out, he had to learn mostly through firsthand experience. &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t know anyone who would climb. In high school, one of my wrestling teammates was interested too but we had to learn on our own.&#x201D; Those days weren&#x2019;t without risk. &#x201C;Without anyone to show me how, learning was a pretty dangerous process and my closest calls probably came in those years.&#x201D;By age 20, Gobright was done with the OC and moved to Yosemite. &#x201C;I got a job at the Ahwahnee and would work enough to be able to climb all the time.&#x201D; Fueled by sprinkled donuts and whatever food he could get his hands on, he spent plenty of days on the rock. Pretty quickly, he was earning a reputation not only for his nutritional habits but also for his extraordinary climbing ability.Along with epic speed climbing like his triple on El Cap, Gobright is known for astounding feats in free solo climbing&#x2026;as in, without a rope. His first big wall rope-less climb was Yosemite&#x2019;s 800-foot Rostrum route. Since then, he&#x2019;s free soloed routes around Yosemite, Colorado, and British Columbia among others.Gobright is a frequent climbing partner of <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/alex-honnolds-perfect-climb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alex Honnold</a> who just set a new standard in free solo with his ascent of El Cap&#x2019;s Free Rider on June 3. That feat set the climbing world ablaze, again, and burnished Honnold&#x2019;s reputation as one of the greatest rock climbers ever. Gobright&#x2019;s following amongst core climbers is right up there too. According to filmmaker and professional climber Cedar Wright, &#x201C;<a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/2035101/brad-gobright-next-great-free-soloist\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the only other guy soloing like him (Gobright) in the US is Honnold</a>.&#x201D;Gobright&#x2019;s ropeless ascent of the Hairstyles and Attitudes route in Colorado&#x2019;s El Dorado Canyon was the sort of achievement that triggers both fear and mad respect. <a href=\"http://www.cedarwright.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wright</a>, who profiled the climber in Safety Third at Telluride MountainFilm, was there to capture the action: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s by far the raddest and scariest thing I&#x2019;ve ever shot.&#x201D;Why would anyone take so much risk? &#x201C;I just love to climb,&#x201D; Gobright said. &#x201C;With free solo, you can do it quickly. You don&#x2019;t need a partner or gear. It&#x2019;s a huge mental challenge. I have to prepare well and get to a point where I&#x2019;m 100% confident about each move that the route takes.&#x201D; Confidence comes from practice. &#x201C;Before I take on a route free solo, I&#x2019;m climbing it many times and rehearsing each move. I try to get to know every square inch of the rock.&#x201D;In so many sports, achievement is driven in part by competitive spirit and ego. &#x201C;For me, I get inspired by other climbers so I don&#x2019;t really feel pressure to compete with them,&#x201D; Gobright said. &#x201C;Besides, ego is dangerous. If you climb to feed your ego, you probably won&#x2019;t prepare very well and you&#x2019;ll get up high on a route and freak out because you&#x2019;re not ready. Humility is mandatory.&#x201D;What about dealing with fear? &#x201C;When I&#x2019;m climbing, I&#x2019;m not thinking about falling. It&#x2019;s not that I don&#x2019;t feel fear, it&#x2019;s more like I manage it by being prepared for each climb,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;Then once I start, I&#x2019;m confident because of my preparation but also aware of my limits so I&#x2019;m not going to do things that are beyond myself.&#x201D;OK, then. Does the height have any effect? &#x201C;When you&#x2019;re climbing, you start at the bottom and the exposure builds gradually. Since I&#x2019;m kind of in a bubble of focus, I don&#x2019;t really get vertigo. It&#x2019;s different when I&#x2019;m rehearsing a section high on a route and drop in from the top. Looking out over the edge from above, I feel the height a lot more.&#x201D;Gobright&#x2019;s unique combination of technical skill, awareness, worth ethic, and humility have powered him to the top of routes that most wouldn&#x2019;t attempt with or without a rope. Then again, few people have such a single-minded devotion to their craft. That&#x2019;s why his climbing achievements have earned him relationships with brands like Gramicci, Blue Water Ropes, Metolius Climbing, Evolv USA, Zeal Optics, Friction Labs, and others.So what can regular people learn from this rock star? Quite a bit, actually. Many of the habits Gobright and other successful climbers practice are also relevant to daily life. Here are just a few to consider:<strong>Plan your route but be adaptable.</strong> &#x201C;All of these dangerous climbs and my best accomplishments have only come after huge preparation and rehearsal,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Because of that, I&#x2019;m also prepared to roll with whatever comes up.&#x201D;<strong>Persistence pays.</strong> A day&#x2019;s success can actually take months to pull off. &#x201C;The three routes on El Cap took me about four months to plan,&#x201D; Gobright said. &#x201C;Now I&#x2019;m focusing on breaking the speed record on The Nose and have been planning that one for the past 18 months.&#x201D;<br><br><strong>Break big projects into manageable pieces and prioritize.</strong> There&#x2019;s a climbing adage that holds true in life. &#x201C;How do you climb a mountain? One pitch (rope length) at a time.&#x201D; That also means focusing on one mountain and pursuing things that fit within your capability. <br><br><strong>Find partners you can trust who share your vision.</strong> &#x201C;Finding the right partner is huge for any success,&#x201D; according to Gobright. &#x201C;In climbing, I look for someone who is capable &#x2013; technically, physically, and mentally. I also look for someone I can trust under pressure because our lives are in each other&#x2019;s hands. And I need someone who really wants to do the project as much as I do because things are always going to get tough at some point.&#x201D; <br><br><strong>Understand how to tap the power of now, being in the moment.</strong> &#x201C;Climbing requires total concentration and focus. Sure, you can lean back and take a break sometimes but when you really want to make progress, you have to be able to lock in.&#x201D; <br><br><strong>Be confident but stay humble.</strong> &#x201C;Confidence comes from being prepared. It&#x2019;s a long process and I get into the details like the order of gear on my climbing belt based on how I&#x2019;ll use it on the route. But even knowing that I&#x2019;m ready, I&#x2019;m still humble enough to respect the demands of the route and the risk. And I recognize my own limits.&#x201D; <br><br><strong>Take time to enjoy the process&#x2026;not just the view at the top.</strong> &#x201C;When I&#x2019;m climbing, I&#x2019;m always super focused. Now and then though, I&#x2019;ll stop on a ledge, look out over the Valley, and take it all in: the view, the grind, and all the work it took to get there. It&#x2019;s all part of the experience and why I climb.&#x201D;<br>While few of us would ever dare to try the stuff that Brad Gobright does, we stand a good chance of scaling our own personal El Capitans by applying some of his techniques.<em>Read more from&#xA0;<a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/author/michael-irwin#filters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Michael</a>.</em><em>Original&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.bottlerocketadvisors.com/bottle-rocket-blog/2017/6/12/school-of-rock-big-wall-lessons-for-the-business-world\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a>.&#xA0;</em><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Humans thrive when they get stuff done. But not just any old stuff&#x2014;stuff that matters. People are born to create and to accumulate results into a body of work they can be proud of. Conversely, we get depressed when we are simply &#x201C;going through the motions&#x201D; with repetitive or mundane tasks that just keep us busy. You&#x2019;ve probably heard of &#x201C;make-work&#x201D; which describes pointless tasks that <em>keep someone busy</em> but do not result in any progress towards something valuable. While keeping busy looks a lot like working, the lack of progress on anything meaningful is dispiriting.Progress is the single most important event leading to positive inner work life, according to the <a href=\"http://www.progressprinciple.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Progress Principle</a> by Teresa Amabile of the Harvard Business School. She describes a positive &#x201C;inner work life&#x201D; as the continuous stream of emotions, perceptions, and motivations that people experience throughout their workdays. And we all know that a positive attitude leads to better efforts and better results.Unfortunately, there are a lot of people out there who get paid for being busy, meaning their output is measured by <em>activity</em> not by value created. Busy people come in earlier, stay later, and never have time for chit-chat in the company kitchen. They are often admired for their work ethic and praised for their heroic commitment to the company. But being busy is a trap&#x2026; as you put more and more effort into something you steadily get less and less out of it. And as you get less out of work you get bored, overwhelmed, sick, and tired. Working a 70-hour week is an amazing feat, but it doesn&#x2019;t signify any sort of progress. This is a problem that is plaguing American businesses according to a <a href=\"http://www.mercer.com//pressrelease/details.htm?idContent=1418665\" target=\"_blank\">recent study by Mercer consulting</a> that noted, &#x201C;Diminished loyalty and widespread apathy can undermine business performance, particularly as companies increasingly look to their workforces to drive productivity gains and spur innovation.&#x201D;<em>Funny, I just realized the term business, is actually busy-ness.</em>Business is often managed with policies that force people to work during certain hours and count their vacation days, yet don&#x2019;t acknowledge the evening or weekend when the employee has dedicated &#x201C;extra hours&#x201D; to complete a project or prepare for a big presentation. Business requires such policies because people don&#x2019;t like to perform make-work.But much of the work businesses accomplish is not make-work; it&#x2019;s real work, just not that interesting or challenging. It&#x2019;s routine, mundane, and predictable. And there&#x2019;s not a lot of autonomy provided in routine jobs, which is another source of frustration. So are we supposed to submit to &#x201C;the man&#x201D; and punch the clock, work for the weekend, and find our joy outside of work? That&#x2019;s not what successful people do.<strong>A quality frame of mind comes from vision and focus.</strong><br> In order to get meaning out of work, you must have vision and focus. With vision and focus, every moment becomes a quest for quality. A quality frame of mind sparks your energy to engage in the difficulties of real work. As observed by <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/401.Robert_M_Pirsig\" target=\"_blank\">Robert M. Pirsig</a>, in his novel&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/175720-zen-and-the-art-of-motorcycle-maintenance-an-inquiry-into-values\" target=\"_blank\">Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance:</a><em>&#xA0;</em><em>A person who sees Quality and feels it as he works is a person who cares.&#xA0;</em>The quality frame of mind is approached from another angle by Victor Frankel, who illustrates the power of personal choice in his book <a target=\"_blank\">Man&#x2019;s Search for Meaning</a>. If a prisoner of war can find joy in a daily routine, despite his most terrible circumstances, then I believe it&#x2019;s possible for anyone to avoid the busy trap and become a victim of a bad job.But how do you &#x201C;see Quality&#x201D; as Pirsig suggests? First you have to know what you want from your work. Is it to pay bills? To learn something? To prove something? To fulfill an ambition or desire? Simply &#x201C;being present&#x201D; in a work setting is not likely to result in real work being accomplished. Answer this question and you will have an end in mind, which is habit #2 of Steven Covey&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://www.stephencovey.com/7habits/7habits-habit2.php\" target=\"_blank\">Seven Habits of Highly Effective People</a>. With the end in mind, you have to have the discipline to focus on only the things that carry you toward that vision. You have to avoid distractions and make difficult trade-offs on how you will spend your time.Despite the value I find in Covey&#x2019;s <em>Seven Habits</em>, I think for most people there&#x2019;s still something missing. Vision and focus are necessary to meaningful work, but they are not sufficient to sustain long-term efforts or overcome difficult circumstances. There&#x2019;s another more fundamental trait involved here called <em>grit</em>, which I&#x2019;ve described before. And Jonah Leher of Wired magazine has a similar post <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/03/what-is-success-true-grit/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.In reading that post, I discovered a point I hadn&#x2019;t noticed before in the U.Penn study, which is that many people find deliberate practice <em>not</em> <em>fun</em>. They have a hard time sticking to their planned routine and suddenly find themselves bored or tired, and ready to quit.So even with a clear vision of what they want to accomplish, and despite great focus on doing the right things to get there, most people still end up in busy mode, going through the motions of routine tasks, but not making any progress (sigh).<strong>Play it out!</strong><strong>&#xA0;</strong><br> According to play expert Brian Sutton-Smith, &#x201C;Play (is) a kind of transcendence. Play is not just fun, not just pleasurable for its own sake. Play makes it possible to live more fully in the world, no matter how boring or painful or even dangerous ordinary reality might seem.&#x201D;The successful people I know always say <em>not</em> to do things unless you are having fun doing them. And if you look closely at successful people, they do a lot of stuff that doesn&#x2019;t seem very fun. So the secret here is not in picking fun work, it&#x2019;s about making work fun. A grand vision is important to spark greatness, but for many people it&#x2019;s too far away, too big, and too abstract to keep them energized through routine, repetitive or physically draining activity. A playful heart to go along with your quality mindset brings fun into any routine.Playing while working is about having small goals built into routine tasks that lift your energies and light your soul. Craftspeople take pride in the precision of a cut, the straightness of an edge, or the smoothness of a surface. This is vision and focus at work. But having the grit to complete a huge floor with hundreds of cuts and thousands of repetitive arm swings takes playful energy.Play can simply be about practicing fundamental skills that will help you be a better person. Or it can be more like a game you play with yourself or a workmate to see who can &#x201C;one up&#x201D; the other. With a quality mindset and a playful heart, you can dig a hole for no other reason than to dig straighter walls and move bigger shovel loads at a faster pace. When you set parameters and add constraints to challenge yourself, boring work feels like fun a game.<strong>Personal growth is a natural result of meaningful work</strong><br> When you zoom into the moment with a quality mindset and play it out during deliberate practice, even the dullest of activities becomes fully engaging, as every new cycle is slightly better than the previous one. You feel real progress and get better results. As I learned through my experience at <a href=\"http://www.ideo.com/us/\" target=\"_blank\">IDEO</a>, working in this way is a form of prototyping. And prototyping is a great method for discovering breakthrough ideas.Prototyping yourself leads you to discover things about yourself you&#x2019;ve never noticed before. These new discoveries are what I learned to call &#x201C;Blinding Flashes of the Obvious&#x201D; (BFOs ). In these unexpected moments, you catch yourself being yourself, which is the first step in personal growth.This is an added bonus to avoiding the busy trap. You get better results in your work, but you also get a better self. And it&#x2019;s fun along the way. What are you waiting for?!Notes:<strong>Work:</strong><br> -English Wircan &#x201C;to operate and to function.&#x201D; Action involving effort or exertion&#x2026;negative connotation has stuck with the word throughout the history of the word.<br> -Also: a noun describing good deeds, a literary or musical composition.<strong>Play:</strong><br> -Dutch Pleien &#x201C;to dance, leap for joy, rejoice&#x201D;&#x2026; English plegian, &#x201C;to exercise/frolic&#x201D;.<br> -Amuse or divert.

       "content_body":"Every organization is doing two things&#x2014;building its brand and driving transactions.It doesn&#x2019;t matter the industry, the size, the for-profit vs. non-profit status. Every entity is building a brand and driving transactions, or some variation of those two universal tasks. The consumer has to know why we&#x2019;re here and what we&#x2019;re about (brand) and how to get involved (transactions). Otherwise, you&#x2019;re out of here.The terminology may change, but you&#x2019;re still doing the same two things. For you, brand building may be &#x201C;establish yourself,&#x201D; or &#x201C;get your name out,&#x201D; or &#x201C;establish street cred,&#x201D; but it&#x2019;s all the same. Driving transactions may be sales or church engagement or volunteer hours or getting views, but it&#x2019;s all the same. It&#x2019;s moving someone to an action step, not just a thinking step. In his TED Talk on &#x201C;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPYeCltXpxw\">Start with Why,</a>&#x201D;&#xA0;Simon Sinek calls it &#x201C;driving behavior.&#x201D;Imagine a business that builds a great, recognizable brand but can&#x2019;t drive transactions. What happens to their P&amp;L? They&#x2019;re sunk. Or imagine a business that drives transactions but can&#x2019;t build a brand. Before you know it, consumers migrate to better branded competitors. Again, our imaginary company is sunk.So why write a blog post about this? Because the challenge of building a brand and driving transactions just got more complicated. Social media and the digital revolution have completely changed the way we think about and go about these two things.<strong>Brand and Transactions Today<br></strong>Throughout the 20<sup>th</sup> century, brand and transactions were all driven through traditional types of marketing&#x2014;TV, radio, print, salespeople, marketing campaigns, etc. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siv57POiJHg\">Watch this commercial</a>&#xA0;and figure out how you&#x2019;re supposed to respond. It&#x2019;s not super subtle.Today, however, I can build a brand and drive transactions without <em>any </em>of these traditional forms of marketing. Google is the best example of this (you used a Google search long before you saw a Google television ad), but there are many other examples&#x2014;AirBnB, Craigslist, Uber. The list is endless.The advent of the digital age and the presence of social media allow businesses: 1) to communicate who they are in new and varied ways and; 2) to drive a response, whether that is &#x201C;follow me on Twitter&#x201D; or &#x201C;repost my Instagram post for a chance to win&#x201D; or &#x201C;click through and make a PayPal purchase.&#x201D;It&#x2019;s not hard to see that there&#x2019;s both enormous opportunity here and enormous challenge. Here are three:A <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/03/branding-in-the-age-of-social-media\">2016 <em>Harvard Business Review</em> article</a>&#xA0;noted that one of the effects of social media has been the rise of the subculture. For example, motorcycle enthusiasts used to just meet occasionally at a rally; now they can meet online every day. The same goes for video gamers, fans of RC Cola, insomniacs, and any other group. Organizations, therefore, can drill down and reach a specific subculture and build a brand and drive transactions with them. Finding, penetrating, and building relational equity with those subcultures is &#x201C;money,&#x201D; as my son says.Countless companies have had their turn at the hot new idea online only to go bankrupt because everyone was visiting their site or following them on social media but not giving them any money. <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/04/10/data-sheet-pandora/\">This is the battle Pandora fights</a>. Pandora has 80 million users, but the question lingers, &#x201C;Will it survive?&#x201D; It&#x2019;s trying ad revenue, monthly subscriptions for &#x201C;Pandora Premium,&#x201D; and more to turn use into financial transactions. Following you, liking you, even sharing you is all free &#x2026; to me. But not to you. Jumping the shark to monetizing social is not easy. Trust me.Consider this. The Wal-Mart YouTube channel has 235,000 subscribers. Coke has 1.6 million. Starbucks 138,000. In contrast, PewDiePie, a Swedish video gamer, has 56 million. Justin Bieber has 30 million. Dude Perfect has 20 million. What&#x2019;s the pattern? It&#x2019;s individuals over corporate. (And kids from 8-18 spend a lot of time on YouTube.)Consumers don&#x2019;t always want the brands that giant corporations churn out. It seems they want something more authentic and independent instead. Therefore, companies have to find ways to be authentic and independent in selling their brand.In this digital age, companies need to make something that people will share with others. So, companies turn out branded content like this:<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pUG3Z8Hxa5I\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>The more it feels like a traditional corporate thing, the less likely they are to share it.<strong>Conclusion<br></strong>Seth Godin said, &#x201C;The connection between running ads and making money is gone, probably forever. &#x2026;The new era of modern marketing is about the connection economy.

It has reached a level of notoriety as the most effective, fastest growing form of self-defense that people are learning to protect themselves. Executives are starting to reference Jiu-Jitsu moves in business conversations and it&#x2019;s not because they&#x2019;re practicing the art. Gracie Jiu-Jitsu is the titanium standard, built on a foundation of effectiveness, confidence, humility and a world-class teaching methodology. There is much CEOs can learn from the Gracies.<br><br>I recently spoke with Rener Gracie, a third generation master of Gracie Jiu-Jitsu, about what CEOs can learn from his style of teaching. In 2008, Rener and his brother, Ryron, were entrusted with the task of making Gracie Jiu-Jitsu easy to learn in every country of the world. Together, they produced the top three home study self-defense programs of all time: Gracie Combatives, Gracie Bullyproof, and Gracie Women Empowered. In addition, they launched GracieUniversity.com, the interactive online learning center of the Gracie Academy, which now has over 45,000 active students in over 189 countries. His remarkable knowledge base and his passionate teaching style make Rener one of the most sought after instructors in the world. When he&#x2019;s not devising new training programs or teaching classes at the Gracie Academy, Rener spends his time traveling the world teaching people of all kinds, from U.S. Military and Law Enforcement personnel to bullied children and Hollywood celebrities.<br><br><strong>Shawn Parr: </strong>What is Gracie Jiu-Jistu?<br><strong>Rener Gracie:</strong> Gracie Jiu-Jitsu is a system of self-defense that was created by my grandfather, Grand Master Helio Gracie, and brought to America by my father, Rorion Gracie. In 1993, my father created the UFC to showcase the effectiveness of the system to the world. It worked. Gracie Jiu-Jitsu was adopted by the U.S. Army and virtually every federal law enforcement organization.<br><br><strong>SP:</strong> How is it different from every other form of Jiu-Jitsu or MMA?<br><strong>RG:</strong> Gracie Jiu-Jitsu is widely considered the most effective self-defense system on the planet, specifically because it is the only one that has proven, over three generations, to enable the weak to defeat the strong.<br><br><strong>SP:</strong> How have you become the fastest growing martial art in the world today?<br><strong>RG:</strong> It works and anyone can learn it. While most other disciplines rely on the physical attributes of the practitioner, Gracie Jiu-JItsu is based entirely on leverage and timing rather than strength, speed, and flexibility, so anyone can learn the techniques and be successful. Since it&#x2019;s so easy to learn, students become instantly addicted to the techniques and the lifestyle.<br><br><strong>SP:</strong> What does the Gracie brand stand for?<br><strong>RG:</strong> Efficiency.<br><br><strong>SP:</strong> Tell us how you started your business?<br><strong>RG:</strong> In America, the journey began in a small garage in Hermosa Beach, California. My father taught private classes for 10 hours a day, 7 days a week, for 11 years. In 1989, he decided to open a school to accommodate the growing number of students, bringing his brothers from Brazil to help make it happen. In 1993, he created the UFC, and the rest is history.<br><br><strong>SP:</strong> What does Gracie Jiu-Jitsu promise its participants?<br><strong>RG:</strong> Confidence, on the mat and in life.<br><br><strong>SP:</strong> What are the key principles you teach as a foundation to the art?<br><strong>RG:</strong> When fighting a giant, don&#x2019;t worry about how you&#x2019;re going to win, focus on not losing. At any given time, be more concerned with what your opponent is trying to do to you than with what you are trying to do to him. If you don&#x2019;t lose, you will eventually win.<br><br><strong>SP:</strong> Why do you think you have such successful results?<br><strong>RG:</strong> For three generations, we&#x2019;ve continuously sought out a more effective and efficient way of doing each technique.<br><br><strong>SP:</strong> What do you think a CEO can learn from these principles?<br><strong>RG:</strong> Learn to be comfortable in the worst case scenarios because once you are, they cease to exist.<br><br><strong>SP:</strong> Why is your teaching methodology so successful?<br><strong>RG:</strong> It has been refined over a span of 85 years and we really care about the students.<br><br><strong>SP:</strong> What do you think CEOs can learn from the Giant Killer move?<br><strong>RG:</strong> Anything is possible.<br><br><strong>SP:</strong> What do you think CEOs can learn from the rear naked choke move?<br><strong>RG:</strong> Leverage your strengths to yield optimum returns with minimal investments.<br><br><strong>SP:</strong> How do you think the idea of &#x201C;less is more&#x201D; applies to business?<br><strong>RG:</strong> Instead of investing more to make more, focusing on making the same with less invested. Once you figure that out, then you can scale up from there and benefit much greater in the long run. The same idea applies to everyday life.<br><br><strong>SP:</strong> Explain why you started the Gracie Bullyproof program?<br><strong>RG:</strong> Realizing how privileged my siblings and I were to be brought up the way we were, I wanted to give parents around the world a step-by-step road map to follow to raise their children the Gracie Way. A child cannot verbally assert him/herself against a bully if he/she feels like they might get hurt. By giving children the skills to neutralize physical attacks, we are giving them the confidence that they will not be hurt by a bully. That confidence will then enable them to speak up against bullies, which, in turn, will lessen their chances of being targeted. The more a child learns to fight, the less likely they are to ever use physical force.<br><br><strong>SP:</strong> Do you think people get bullied at work? How do your principles apply here?<br><strong>RG:</strong> Exactly the same as with children&#x2014;as long as a person fears physical or emotional injury, they will not assert themselves. With Gracie Jiu-Jitsu in your back pocket, you have nothing to fear, so you can speak up and confront bullies without violence and that will almost always put an end to it.<br><br><strong>SP:</strong> If you could change one thing about Gracie Jiu-Jitsu what would it be?<br><strong>RG:</strong> Make it available in more countries around the world. We developed <a href=\"https://gracieuniversity.com/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">GracieUniversity.com</a>, an interactive online learning center for Gracie Jiu-Jitsu, and we have over 45,000 active students in 189 countries. However, there are 195 countries in the world, so we still have some work to do.<br><br><strong>SP:</strong> What&#x2019;s the best advice you were ever given?<br><strong>RG:</strong> Help enough people get what they want, and you can have ANYTHING you want.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Nike&#x2019;s Global Sportswear team challenged our partners at Leviathan to get the right people talking about (and testing out) the brand&#x2019;s new winter line of SneakerBoots and Tech Pack Aeroloft jackets on social media. Leviathan came up with the initial idea of &#x201C;<a href=\"http://www.lvthn.com/work/test-stride/\">Test Stride</a>&#x201D;&#x2014;a new high-tech and immediate &#x201C;social media sharable&#x201D; approach to gear testing for consumers. They wanted media, influencers, celebrities and athletes talking about the new winter line and got it by presenting a rewarding way to try it together in a social environment.Leviathan&#x2019;s expertise in creating engaging interactive digital experiences and integrating them into physical environments naturally took the project in an experiential direction. Their goal&#x2014;to create an attractive, advanced and exciting way to test and share Nike&#x2019;s latest performance gear. Specifically, the Nike team wanted to harness the most popular elements of Leviathan&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.lvthn.com/work/\">past work</a> and combine them with real-world product trials. The end goal&#x2014;prove some very specific product features and benefits to trial participants, including the products&#x2019; ability to keep wearers warm, dry and safe from slipping in treacherous winter conditions.Recreating real-life scenarios, like city streets, for the event was an integral part of the project.<em>&#x201C;A key strategy of this project was to prove that your style shouldn&apos;t suffer just because the weather gets tough, so we knew our idea had to be both functional on an athletic level yet attractive on a contemporary design level.&#x201D;</em> said Jason White, Leviathan&#x2019;s Executive Creative Director. <em>&#x201C;Our solution was an interactive urban obstacle course&#x2014;a competitive time trial that tests participants&#x2019; physical strength and agility, while ensuring they look good when racing through it.&#x201D;</em>&#x201C;<em>It quickly dawned on us that we needed physical elements, like actual water and actual concrete.&#x201D;</em> recalls White. &#x201C;The obstacle course concept quickly became the obvious route, but having the solution be digitally interactive was something the design team had never seen or executed before.&#x201D;According to White, the project&#x2019;s design work began with conceptual sketches and then progressed to 3D modeling using Autodesk&#x2019;s Maya. <em>&#x201C;To translate our ambitious ideas into production-ready schematics, we teamed up with the talented designers at </em><em>, who design and build some of the world&#x2019;s best sets for theaters, museums and retail.&#x201D;</em> he said, <em>&#x201C;CS was able to complete our vision with exact measurements and collaborate with us on material suggestions.&#x201D;</em>The &#x201C;Test Stride&#x201D; space begins with an entrance space where competitors can sign up via a tablet and then opens up into a large room where the obstacle course sits in a 170-foot-long U-shape. Alongside the course, the team placed a vivid 30-foot-wide, 9-foot-high LED screen. The massive screen served several purposes&#x2014;to create motion and depth, to display encouraging messages and stats to participants, and to play triggered animation sequences.Each of the five obstacles was categorized by a thematic zone that acted in concert with the features and benefits of the gear being tested. The five zones were Ascend, Traverse, Escape, Vault and Leap. The corresponding obstacles were jagged terrain, a flooded streetscape, a barricaded alley, a taxi and a concrete stair. Each terrain was accompanied by a custom 3-D and motion animation built by the Leviathan team.<em>&#x201C;In each instance, there was a great opportunity to push boundaries and create something truly unique. This particular activation is the perfect blend of cinematic content, groundbreaking interactivity and physical environments&#x2014;exactly where we&#x2019;re strongest.&#x201D; detailed</em> White.By design, the project&#x2019;s interactivity was implemented so integrally as to be subliminal. One example is the system that tracks each participant&#x2019;s progress and triggers new content as they move through the various thematic zones. Leviathan&#x2019;s Interactive Director Austin Mayer explained, &#x201C;<em>That system consists of laser-based optical ranging sensors to track movement, Arduino to bridge the physical-digital signal and TouchDesigner to cue pre-rendered video layers, integrate real-time effects, composite the photo moment and cue audio in Ableton Live. All of these technologies combine to render the course results in real time on the LED screen.&#x201D;</em>Additional custom brand media content was created for event ambiance, taking the form of short surreal CG vignettes about Nike SneakerBoots&#x2019; counterattack on winter conditions. Throughout the clips winter elements, like snow, pelting rain and spiky ice aggressively stage an assault on the SneakerBoots. The videos deftly match the spiked LED-lit product displays placed around the space to promote product engagement and photography.The project kicked off in Shanghai, and all parties witnessed the collaboration&#x2019;s stunning results. Coverage of the event was global, generating excitement around Nike&#x2019;s release for premiere streetwear and fashion media outlets.<em>&#x201C;I think the event was particularly successful and unique to Nike because of the combination of art exhibit, next-level of interactive technology and physical activity.&#x201D;</em> states White.&#xA0;<strong><em>Read our other <a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/partner-showcase-leviathan-project-150-media-stream\">Partner Showcases</a>. </em></strong><strong><em>More about our friends at Leviathan</em></strong><strong><br></strong><a href=\"http://www.lvthn.com/\">Leviathan</a>&#xA0;is a specialized creative agency working at the nexus of design, digital media and interaction.

       "content_body":"I felt instantly compelled to share this graphic and disturbing story from an 19 year-old American college student, who is spending three months in the West Bank to study Arabic. This won&#x2019;t be on CNN or in the New York Times.On Friday morning, December 9th, my friend and I set out to experience a West Bank protest. It was a first for both of us, seeing as I have Arabic class every Friday, and he lives in Tel Aviv. As&#xA0;protest&#xA0;virgins, we had no idea what to expect. What did a confrontation look like? How do people protest? How would the soldiers react? I&#x2019;d heard tales of people dodging tear gas canisters and running from bullets.We ended up attending the protest in Nabi Saleh, coincidently on its two year anniversary date of weekly protests. The source of the conflict was the confiscation of much of the town&#x2019;s land and its only&#xA0;water well due to the construction of the nearby illegal Israeli settlement of Halamish.&#xA0;Furthermore, the IDF under the mandate to protect Israeli citizens (the occupants of the illegal settlements), makes frequent&#xA0;night raids, surprise home invasions where children are dragged from their beds for interrogation, documentation, and sometimes detention.Every Friday the townspeople and activists gather and attempt to march to the stolen water well, but as I was to experience, rarely make it out of their village.After noontime prayers the protest began. We walked down the main road and towards the highway leading to the well. We didn&#x2019;t get far. Shortly after rounding a bend, we found the IDF waiting for us.&#xA0;I was a little surprised to see the soldiers so early in our march, still within the town precinct and still quite a distance from the well. Obviously intent on stopping our forward progress, the army commenced a&#xA0;volley of tear gas canisters and rubber bullets. In response, some of the local kids and youth began returning the military crowd retardants with stones along the road.The inequality of their fight struck me.&#xA0;It was David vs. Goliath, inaccurate slingshots vs. scoped rifles firing lead-cored rubber bullets, taunts and jeering vs. concussion grenades and tear gas, and&#xA0;teens in t-shirts vs. soldiers in body armor.&#xA0;My image of myself as fearless faded as I watched little girls lightly skip out of the way of concussion grenades, and boys compete over who threw the tear gas&#xA0;canisters up wind. To me, this was the next world war. For them, this was a regular day off from school.What seemed like a game, became deadly serious when a young man at the protest, Mustafa Tamimi, was shot in the face by a high velocity tear gas canister from very close range (approx. 8-10&#xA0;meters). The ambulance that had been at the ready for the protest earlier was already in use. Fellow protesters lifted Mustafa&#x2019;s limp body into a passenger van.Like our protest march, the van holding Mustafa didn&#x2019;t make it very far. For some reason, the soldiers felt it appropriate to detain the vehicle at the edge of town. I watched and waited with tears in my eyes for the van to&#xA0;whisk Mustafa to a place that could attend to his grievous wounds. 5 minutes. 10 minutes. 15 minutes. I watched as his family and women in the village ran wailing and screaming towards the soldiers begging&#xA0;them to let him go. More time passed. Finally, an Israeli ambulance shuttled Mustafa Tamimi to the hospital.A Palestinian aid giver on her way back from having been with Mustafa, walked straight up to the soldiers and began to vent.&#x201C;You killed an innocent man today! Do you even care? You&#x2019;re animals, that&#x2019;s all you are! You don&#x2019;t have souls! You&#x2019;re just doing what Hitler did to you, you Nazis!&#x201D; There was more said, but I can&#x2019;t remember their exact words.I felt her anger. As she spoke my sadness only deepened. Like the aid worker, I too wanted more than anything to see the soldiers show a sign of remorse&#x2014;to feel the gravity of their actions,&#xA0;acknowledge the pain they were responsible for. However, in the face of screamed accusations, I realized that their chance for understanding was going the way of their diminished humanity.Yesterday I learned that Mustafa Tamimi died in the hospital. Seeing that the Israeli media spin has commenced with a vengeance, it is questionable whether there will be justice for what I experienced.&#xA0;This doesn&#x2019;t change the facts:<strong>Men shouldn&#x2019;t die while walking to their own water well</strong><strong>Children shouldn&#x2019;t become accustomed to tear gas and rubber bullets in their backyards</strong><strong>Soldiers shouldn&#x2019;t be ordered to protect stolen property</strong><strong>Another&#x2019;s humanity should never be denied</strong><strong>Refuse to be enemies</strong><strong>&#x2014;Andrew Haas</strong><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"As corporate leaders explore how to elevate the effectiveness and professional excellence of their working teams, there is a lot to be learned from the Navy SEALs.&#xA0;Their collaboration with other branches of the military over the past decade make them an area of the military that both corporate America and the government can learn a lot from. I&#x2019;ve been a longtime fan of the Navy SEALs and in my constant search for inspiration to implement work culture and leadership change, I felt they could be a superb group to learn from. While this highly secretive branch of the military keeps themselves, and their secrets, to themselves, books like <em>Lone Survivor</em>, and <em>The Hunt for Bin Laden</em> give us a look into how they operate. But nothing beats sitting down with a Navy SEAL Commander to understand how they think about leadership.The contrast between corporate and military leadership are distinctively different for obvious reasons: The military&#x2019;s leadership is focused on leading organizations responsible for our country&#x2019;s security and fighting wars, while business leaders are focused on creating value and protecting the interests of their stakeholders, with profit and return on investment often being the top priorities.<strong>Meticulous planning</strong><br> From a management standpoint, one of the greatest lessons that can be learned from Navy SEALs is their skill of being highly effective and meticulous planners. They focus on the importance of time management, on-target execution and completing the mission. They operate with a back-up and&#xA0;contingency plan in place for almost every scenario.&#xA0;One of the most practical skills taught in this branch is clear and direct communication. Most people think that the military teaches direct, one-way communication&#x2014;but what&#x2019;s less&#xA0;obvious to non-military folks is the importance SEALs place on listening. SEAL Commanders listen and formulate an opinion that incorporates as many ideas and experiences as possible to form a solid plan. A big difference between Navy&#xA0;SEAL and civilian leadership is that once a Commander&#x2019;s decision is reached, the discussion is over&#x2014;then full support and backing is given and a unified front is presented. Ultimate accountability rests on the Commander&#x2019;s shoulders.<strong>Clear expectations</strong><br> Navy SEALs focus on a very clear set of objectives, where significant importance is placed on defining the goal and motivating the team to follow.&#xA0;Even with highly complex operations, each SEAL has a clearly defined role, and expectations&#xA0;can be recited by each team member. Similarly, articulating a compelling vision and aligning people with priorities are vital areas in business, but are often overlooked by many leaders. The SEAL&#x2019;s rules of engagement (how they respond when confronted) are clearly established before each mission, and modifying these rules could negatively impact the entire operation. The rules of engagement for businesses (what is acceptable employee behavior and what is not) are very often ill-defined or non-existent. One of the biggest disconnects we see in business is the gap between a company&#x2019;s strategy and the aligned expectations set for the employees.When talking to a SEAL Commander, he offers tangible advice that can be applied in business:<strong>1. Learn how to work as a team</strong><br> A mission cannot be successfully executed unless the team is functioning as one. The SEALs continual emphasis on teamwork corresponds closely with the daily&#xA0;requirements of the business world.<strong>2. SEALs are put into leadership positions of significance early in their careers and become comfortable in that role</strong><br> This opportunity is unparalleled in the corporate world, where an employee may&#xA0;need 10-15 years to reach a position of significant leadership and high level of responsibility.<strong>3. A highly developed sense of ethics and integrity is a common mindset in the SEAL community</strong><br> In the world of business, the ethical leader is sometimes a rarity, and truly esteemed.<strong>4. The ability to remain calm under pressure is a SEAL expectation</strong><br> The military trains their team to be more comfortable taking risks with incomplete information. This is the daily function of a CEO, but is rarely passed down to employees.<strong>5. SEALs quickly learn that the punishment and pain of training prepares them to adapt quickly to tough mission environments</strong><br> Young executives who go through hard times should learn to appreciate&#xA0;them, recognizing that those times will not only strengthen them, but truly train them to properly and successfully lead their own teams when battling the competition.<strong>6. Force your competition onto their heels</strong><br> In an ambush, always take out&#xA0;the&#xA0;radio operator and the unit leader (usually the guy next to the radioman). Without leadership or good communication the enemy&#xA0;is forced into disarray and can be picked apart. A good lesson for all leaders and their organizations.<strong>7. Study Darwin</strong><br> Survival is not about who&#x2019;s the strongest or fastest, but who can best adapt to change. Navy SEAL&#x2019;s are masters of adaptation, being able to operate in jungle, desert or artic conditions. In comparison, CEOs&#xA0;must adapt to the ever-changing market conditions they face daily and should train their staff to do the same.&#xA0;<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span><em>Photo: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/lwpkommunikacio/9200053400/sizes/m/in/photostream/\" target=\"_blank\">lwpkommunikacio</a></em>"

       "content_body":"When I say I travel a lot for business, there&#x2019;s not an ounce of male exaggeration in that statement. I fly the skies on multiple airlines, many legs and on various types of planes, navigating this beautiful and vast continent of ours. There are many weeks it feels like I&#x2019;m in the air more than I&#x2019;m on the ground. I&#xA0;like to think of myself as a business explorer rather than a road warrior, voyeuristically observing my surroundings, noting and documenting the idiosyncrasies and similarities of every traveling human and town I encounter across the country.&#xA0;I marvel at the number of people traveling every single day by plane, train and automobile; and&#xA0;I&#x2019;m here to tell you there is absolutely nothing glamorous or pleasant about domestic travel.When I&#xA0;travel, the original Star Trek series often comes to mind. The creators laid out a vision, with imagined products and gadgets they thought would be a reality in the future. Things that seemed highly imaginative have become a reality today. Every episode opened with a voiceover saying that space was the final frontier; and while Richard Branson now has that covered,&#xA0;there is little that is more important than the service frontier.Great service is a rarity rather than the norm, and I find myself constantly disappointed. I have hundreds of opportunities each week to experience the service of many providers in the travel business and it is for the most part average and forgettable.&#xA0;More often than not, staff at all parts of the chain are disengaged or insincere when dealing with their customers. So, when I do experience great service it jumps out and hugs me. Without excellent service the customer experience is forgettable at best. The money spent on the physical spaces and experiences mean very little to guests unless they are paired with memorable and attentive service.We are fortunate to work with many large brands that value their people and are extremely committed to elevating their service experience.&#xA0;While in the middle of numerous cultural, service and experience design projects that span hospitality, health and fitness, and food service industries, I began searching for inspiration.<strong>When are two stars better than four?</strong><br> Focusing on the star theme, the ultra luxury hotel chain, <a href=\"http://www.capellahotels.com/default-en.html\">Capella Hotels</a>, has a celestial namesake that is a double star.&#xA0;I recently had the opportunity to visit their property in Cabo San Lucas on some field research and was thrilled and surprised by the exceptional customer service I experienced. They claim to have built a brand that represents the dual relationship and intimacy between some of the most luxurious hotels in the world and the&#xA0;guests they hold in the highest esteem. They delivered on their promise: &#x201C;service that has no equal&#x201D;. The staff was genuinely engaged, happy in their roles and delighted to serve. They carefully attended to my every need and interacted with the utmost respect. After doing some research, it was no surprise that the management team behind this world-class operation comes from the renowned Ritz-Carlton Group.<strong>Feel the Hamptonality&#xA0;</strong><br> There are a number of shining stars in the galaxy of travel options, and one that shines out among the crowd is <a href=\"http://hamptoninn3.hilton.com/en/index.html?WT.srch=1\">Hampton</a>. Working with Hilton Hotels, we&#x2019;ve come to appreciate the level of commitment and investment they put into training and engaging their employees and customers. The focus they emphasize on creating a living and breathing guest-centric culture is unparalleled. Once you visit one of their properties you will experience that individual and attentive level of service firsthand. Their model is built on the notion that if you unlock each staff member&#x2019;s individuality and strengths each will deliver a genuine level of Hampton hospitality. What they describe as Hamptonality can be experienced from property to property, and their service consistency is remarkably high for an organization that is franchise-driven.<strong>How a little chips and salsa can get your guests talking</strong><br> Every afternoon at Capella Pedregal a bowl of fresh tortilla chips and salsa and two chilled bottles of Corona are left in your room. Perfectly timed and appropriately themed for the location, this simple daily delight is remarkably effective in getting guests excited about service and a reminder that it&#x2019;s the small touches that count.<strong>Goodbye or Good Riddance: why the departure experience matters&#xA0;</strong><br> It&#x2019;s easy for service staff to greet you on arrival and make you feel special, but it&#x2019;s just as important to think about your guest&#x2019;s departure experience. Whether it&#x2019;s exiting a plane, departing a hotel or restaurant, how you&#x2019;re treated as you exit is the very last impression, and possibly a key prompter that will encourage a return visit.<strong>Why &#x201C;It&#x2019;s my pleasure&#x201D; genuinely means &#x201C;It&#x2019;s their pleasure&#x201D;</strong><br> When you stay at one of the Ritz-Carlton properties, you will experience <em>ladies and gentlemen serving ladies and gentlemen</em>. Their service values are building blocks for what drives their staff on how to engage with customers. While this might sound mechanical, it drives an amazingly consistent service experience across the entire hotel and sets expectations for all staff members.<strong>Word of mouth and loyalty are ultimately driven by a leadership culture of service</strong><br> As a company, your quality of service is a direct result of your leadership strategy and your priorities. If serving your guests is not a priority, you&#x2019;ll never get the credit, satisfaction or the superior business results you&#x2019;re seeking. Defining what your brand of service looks and feels like, then setting a meaningful and actionable platform to engage every employee with clear expectations is paramount to success. The&#xA0;level of importance you put on genuine customer service will play a major part in determining your company&#x2019;s sustainable, competitive differentiation. Is&#xA0;service a pain or a pleasure, a forethought or an afterthought?<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"I was on a panel a few weeks back and an astute student in the audience asked each panelist to share a book she had read recently with the audience. An all-female panel at an all-women&#x2019;s college&#x2014;the inspiration, energy, and enthusiasm in the room were all high. One panelist confessed that she had recently picked up a book &#x201C;because she had never read a book with a female Asian protagonist before and she wanted to know what it felt like.&#x201D;My heart sank.She&#x2019;s not alone.In 2016, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/female-protagonists-historical-high-2016_us_58ac5c21e4b07028b7041d3d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">women made up less than one-third of the protagonists</a> in top movies. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/02/22/467665890/hollywood-has-a-major-diversity-problem-usc-study-finds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">28% of speaking roles in Hollywood</a> belong to people of color. <a href=\"http://blog.leeandlow.com/2013/06/17/why-hasnt-the-number-of-multicultural-books-increased-in-eighteen-years/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">10% of children&#x2019;s books</a> feature people of color.

I&#x2019;ve never run a session in which Steve Jobs, Sergei Brin, Bill Gates, and Warren Buffet were not mentioned.Typically at some point in the middle of the session, panic sets in because after initially jotting down every entrepreneur that comes to mind, people (both men and women, by the way) realize they are sitting in a gender equality session and start racking their brains for &#x201C;that woman from eBay&#x201D; (that would be Meg Whitman), &#x201C;the CEO of GM&#x201D; (that would be Mary Barra), or &#x201C;oh I know, the lady who leads IBM (that would be Ginni Rometty).When pencils go down, most people have 1&#x2013;2 women on their lists and dozens of men. This is no accident.You see, we are all defined by the stories that shape us, and in the world of business and tech, even the stories have their own language. Business is run by &#x201C;titans,&#x201D; we all love a good &#x201C;David versus Goliath&#x201D; company rivalry, and the heroes of these stories are, more often than not straight, white men.Harvard Business School, the creator of many of the world&#x2019;s best business stories in the form of cases, examined the narratives the school produced and found that just&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/5/4/tacking-gender-inequality-at-hbs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">10% of HBS cases had female protagonists</a>.<br>But what&#x2019;s even more depressing than the current status of business narratives is complacency&#x2014;<a href=\"https://womenintheworkplace.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">almost half of men and one third of women</a> believe that women are well-represented in leadership when just one in ten senior leaders is female.<strong>For the story of female leadership in business to have a different ending, we need a more diverse set of heroes.</strong> Even if your company&#x2019;s board or executive leadership is not as gender diverse as you would like it to be, you can take a hard look at the stories you tell in your organization and to your customers and make the heroes of the stories you share significantly more diverse.It may seem like a small step in the grand scheme of things, but as my colleague so bravely shared above&#x2014;it matters, both to the current generation of leaders and those that will come after them. Below, in celebration of International Women&#x2019;s Day, are three ways anyone, anywhere, can #pressforprogress with the stories you share and the heroes you highlight.<strong>1. Take a hard look at your marketing materials.</strong> <br>Last year, Refinery29 and Getty Images partnered to create <a href=\"http://press.gettyimages.com/getty-images-and-refinery29-expand-content-partnership-with-the-launch-of-the-no-apologies-collection/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stock imagery</a> that showed more diverse female representation, a commitment to making their brand more reflective and inclusive of what women actually look like in real life versus perpetuating stereotypes.But whether you&#x2019;re a massive consumer brand or have a small business blog, you&#x2019;re creating heroes in your own marketing efforts, whether you know it or not.What if you made the &#x201C;sales rep&#x201D; in your image a woman of color?What if you illustrated a female CEO instead of a traditionally male one?What if the default setting for an engineer icon was a woman?These may sound like small questions, but they can have a meaningful impact in how your customers experience and promote your brand.<strong>2. Diversify who you learn from.</strong> <br>If your company&#x2019;s leadership isn&#x2019;t as diverse as you might like, consider who your organization admires and learns from on a regular basis. Two years ago, we took a hard look at learning opportunities in our organization. These include:And we began to make a concerted attempt to hear from a more diverse group of voices. The very act of asking ourselves to source more gender diverse talent helped us land remarkable speakers and have far more dynamic conversations around leadership and business.<strong>3. Create space and time for promotion.</strong> <br>Many women are quick to highlight the accomplishments of others, but rarely brag about themselves, so if you&#x2019;re looking for a surefire way to diminish Imposter Syndrome and promote confidence in women at your workplace, create opportunities for women to encourage and promote each other.At HubSpot, we&#x2019;ve:Creating opportunities for men and women to nominate women they admire for visible positions and highlighting female leaders you admire creates intentional spaces and time to make a dent in the confidence and aspiration gap so deeply rooted in the modern workplace.<br>One of my favorite lines in the musical Hamilton is <em>&#x201C;who lives, who dies, who tells your story.&#x201D;</em> It&#x2019;s a simple but powerful reminder that the stories we tell have a profound impact on the reality that you create. We all grew up on fairy tales, so we are conditioned to use stories as a means to convey what matters.The more we thoughtfully consider the heroes we promote, admire, and highlight, the more likely we are to pave the path toward a more inclusive future.&#xA0;<em>Read more from <a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/author/katie-burke#filters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Katie</a>.</em><em>Original post on <a href=\"https://thinkgrowth.org/why-heroes-matter-f384a992be4c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ThinkGrowth</a>.</em><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Working alongside executive leadership teams at companies, I find that one of the key opportunities for growth and transformation is when leaders recognize the need to revisit, refresh or redefine the key building blocks that drive their business. When the CEO or CMO realizes it&#x2019;s time to reinvigorate and reposition their brand it oftentimes highlights the need to refine or redefine their overall business strategy.There is a lack of understanding around some of the most important building blocks for change. More often than not, there is a lack of agreement around what vision, mission and values actually mean, why they&#x2019;re important and how to put them into action to drive growth. Oftentimes, prior work in this space is discounted because it&#x2019;s either outdated or irrelevant, and it ends-up living in generic and forgettable statements mounted on plaques in conference rooms.If a team doesn&#x2019;t have a clear and compelling reason to get out of bed each day, know where they&#x2019;re heading, how they&#x2019;re going to get there and understand the rules of the road, they operate in a vacuum and are driving blind. When teams realize they&#x2019;re lost and often doing the wrong things, the organization usually starts to spin until someone says stop and asks for help.For startups to successfully take off a clear vision is key. The vision paints a succinct and competitive picture of why the brand exists. It helps illustrate how they see the future as a result of their influence on it, helping them raise money, attract talent and kick-start momentum. Startups that have their vision nailed get out of the gate the fastest and drive their business efficiently. Start a business without a foundational brand platform and it will go nowhere fast.As a fresh way to look at their business, leadership teams at larger organizations need to think like passionate entrepreneur&apos;s who are entering their space. By revisiting and examining the reason their company exists and the role it plays in the world, it can reveal significant opportunities for dynamic change. It&#x2019;s not about manufacturing a widget, selling a particular product or hitting a revenue target (<em>although these are all imperative</em>), but digging for a deeper, more meaningful reason the company exists in the world. Ensuring that each member of your team understands, and can clearly articulate your purpose, can unlock new momentum and help drive new focus. Brands are like people, and without purpose they can drift aimlessly. Building a clear brand platform and keeping it alive is key. The platform should inform every facet of the business. Establishing clarity and buy-in to the company&apos;s vision, mission and values ensures that the strategy is clearly built from that foundation and can be shared as a compelling story your people will proudly execute against. Here are some of Uncommon Sense questions to consider when refreshing and redefining your company&#x2019;s brand platform and turning your strategy into a compelling story people understand.<strong>Vision is a clear picture of the future. Do you have one?&#xA0;<br></strong>If your company vision isn&#x2019;t clear, and if your team isn&#x2019;t talking about the impact you&#x2019;re trying to make in the world, then it&#x2019;s time to revisit it. The vision&#xA0;should be a clear statement that paints a picture of how you see the world changed based on your brand&#x2019;s role in it. The vision should be big and bold. It should be a stretch, thought-provoking and inspiring. Map out the future and the role you&#x2019;ve played in it thus far. Having a vision makes your brand&#x2019;s &#x201C;why&#x201D; easy to define. People need a paycheck and a career path, but they want to be a part of something bigger&#x2014;have a clear vision and you will bring clarity to your brand.<strong>Mission is how you intend to make your vision a reality. Are you on one?<br></strong>A mission statement is not theoretical, but rather makes a factual declaration of your brand&#x2019;s intent. Think about a mission statement much like a clearly articulated military mission. It&#x2019;s definitive and directional&#x2014;it maps and identifies what your brand plans to do, and how it will realize its vision.<strong>Values are the beliefs and principles that guide your actions. Are yours clear?<br></strong>Values are imperative&#x2014;they are what the company believes in. They are fundamental beliefs that define the human-centered principles that guide the brand&#x2019;s decision-making, debates and disagreements, and help define the character and integrity of the company. Hiring based on the company values is fundamental. When these values are universally understood they help to shape the company&#x2019;s authenticity and culture. If you or your team can&#x2019;t remember your brand&#x2019;s values or describe how to use them, then it&#x2019;s time to reexamine and redefine the values.<strong>Strategy is how you get there. Have you written yours?<br></strong>A well-crafted strategy is like the unfolding plot in a great story, it connects the characters, helps define their actions and compels the audience to pay attention and stay engaged. A compelling and clear strategy deliberately directs and guides the actions of employees, ensuring they have clear focus and are directionally connected to the overall goals of the company. Strategy defines the actions that complete your brands mission.<strong>Is your 3-year strategy clear?<br></strong>A well thought through, data-driven strategy that is clearly defined and shared in a compelling manner creates confidence and connection among everyone responsible for driving the brand. Validating your existing strategy, or developing a new strategy based on the current or pending conditions of the business, is the responsibility of a responsive, diligent and adaptive leader. Strategy that is delivered like a compelling story will help achieve the brand mission and deliver meaningful results.&#xA0;<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"by Soon YuIf you can pull your eyes away from the hip haircuts of today&#x2019;s coolest kids and take a look at their feet, you&#x2019;re likely to see a pair of Vans on them. It&#x2019;s quite impressive how Vans has managed to stay fresh and cool for 50 years. When it started out, it was known as the Van Doren Rubber Company and&#x2014;rather unusually&#x2014;it manufactured shoes and sold them directly to the public. On its very first morning, 12 customers purchased shoes that were made that very day and ready to be picked up in the afternoon.These days Vans sells over a million pairs each year, many of which are the original design made on that first day of business. And these classic Vans slip-ons have become an icon for creative street culture all around the world. So how does a brand, with such humble beginnings, reach and sustain iconic status? By actively building Iconic Advantage&#xAE;.Iconic Advantage isn&#x2019;t just something companies luck into, it&#x2019;s a deliberate strategy that focuses on building timeless distinction and relevance so businesses can rise above their competition and build stronger emotional connections with their audience. It&#x2019;s a strategy that applies across every area of an organization. And it&#x2019;s a strategy that helps you stay focused on what matters year after year.Most manufacturing industries are on a runaway train heading towards faster, cheaper, and more commoditized products. It&#x2019;s all about quantity, quantity, quantity&#x2014;which pushes quality into fourth place. Because why would you need to create a jacket that can last years when it&#x2019;s likely to be replaced by another one in a matter of months? The companies that embrace this trend are all focused on what&#x2019;s next. They&#x2019;re concerned only with the new.But being iconic is about taking a step back and looking at the now and the then. It&#x2019;s often about innovating on your oldness to create something that rises above the accelerating speed of consumption. It allows a company to take an existing asset they&#x2019;ve already invested heavily in and develop it to make it more distinctive, relevant, and universal &#x2013; the three essential ingredients that lead to iconicity.The iconic part is important. Like religious icons and cultural icons, we&#x2019;re talking about properties that have meaning, relevance, and an emotional connection with an audience. Over time, these are properties that have become the standard-bearer for their category, niche, segment, or movement. We can learn as much from Andy Warhol and NSYNC as we can from Apple and BMW on this subject. It&#x2019;s this stronger human connection that helps to create a real, sustainable business advantage in the market. It generates true loyalty and can result in sales volumes that drive costs down and multiply profit margins.To create something iconic, you need to stand out from the competition. And this is the soul of your Iconic Advantage. The goal is to supercharge the three qualities that make a product iconic: distinction, timeless relevance, and universal recognition.<strong>Create Noticing Power:</strong> It&#x2019;s impossible to stand out by being the same. Yet, most markets end up filled with generic products with a similar list of features. You need to make your offering distinctive. You need to stand out. The best iconic products create lasting iconic signature elements that not only look markedly different but also are own-able. Rather than just being different for the sake of it, theses signature elements embody the brand&#x2019;s key point of difference in a meaningful way.<br><br><strong>Develop Staying Power:</strong> You can&#x2019;t build an iconic brand without developing a deeper connection with your audience. You need to make it timelessly relevant so it sticks around. The best kind of iconic brand has a story to it. This can be the heritage of the brand. Or standing for something radically different from the rest of the market. Or the breakthrough science that delivers a meaningful benefit. This is what gives the brand a deeper connection with the audience that you could never achieve with mere aesthetics.<br><br><strong>Build Scaling Power:</strong> Once you&#x2019;ve got the first two principles in place, you need to give your iconic property as much presence as possible to become universally recognized. The goal is to scale your iconic signature elements by increasing awareness through marketing, availability through distribution and presence through product/service extensions.<br>These three steps create distinction, relevance, and recognition, which form the core of an Iconic Advantage strategy. So how did Vans manage to pull this off?In the pursuit of creating the &#x201C;grippiest&#x201D; skateboard shoes for even the most gravity defying tricks, Vans developed a unique waffle-shaped rubber sole that has become the standard bearer for performance and a lasting signature element for the brand. Along with some classic styles and silhouettes, including the checkered patterned slip-ons, these signature elements help Vans create considerable Noticing Power, even in the most crowded skate parks. Now Vans just needed to make sure it held on to its fickle market. And that&#x2019;s something it has done amazingly well.<br>Vans continues to build powerful relationships with its market by supporting street culture through the annual Vans Warped Tour concert series. This event has been bringing up-and-coming and established talent in a range of musical genres to hip audiences for over 20 years. But its real stroke of genius for developing Staying Power is in the collaborations that help it stay on top of the latest movements in youth culture.Married to their iconic rubber sole was the simple idea that the top of the shoes would serve as canvases for creative expression, allowing for artistic mash-ups with key street and pop culture influencers. Very quickly the shoes were adopted by one of the most fashion-conscious communities. If you look back through the company&#x2019;s history, you can find vintage shoes featuring designs based on timeless iconic franchises including the Beatles, the Simpsons, Star Wars, Hello Kitty, Major League Baseball, and Disney, as well as rare collections in collaboration with famous designers such as Kenzo, Marc Jacobs, and Takashi Murakami.2 This has resulted in both Noticing Power and Staying Power.Recently, the creative leadership team at Vans took the company&#x2019;s Staying Power and Scaling Power to another level. Instead of just working with famous collaborators, the team tapped into the creativity of its community by updating the Vans Customs platform for people to create one-of-a-kind designs using Vans&#x2019; iconic shoes as their canvas. This is an amazing way to make the brand even more relevant to its audience and give customers a deeper emotional connection with the Vans brand, while at the same time helping to build greater recognition for the brand. Custom Vans shoes are so popular that they have become a canvas of choice for artists, who often sell their uniquely printed shoes on Etsy. Naturally, this has resulted in a huge amount of valuable PR and social media noise. This is the most powerful form of Scaling Power since it is organic and driven by the community itself.It&#x2019;s this creative approach to building Iconic Advantage that&#x2019;s helped Vans stay on top of a constantly shifting market to reach iconic status. As long as there are skateboards and rock &#x2018;n&#x2019; roll, it will have an audience that&#x2019;s always connected to its sole.&#xA0;Original <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/keep-your-sole-forever-young-soon-yu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a>.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

In such a media saturated society, it&#x2019;s easy to feel an overwhelming sense of hopelessness and lack of power. So we turn off the news and scroll Facebook hoping to find a funny cat video that will allow us to take our minds off of the mess.&#xA0;<strong>We don&#x2019;t need distractions, we need the whole truth.</strong>It turns out, all news isn&#x2019;t bad news. There is actually good news out there and we need to start reading it, talking about it and taking a moment to relish in it. There are reasons to have hope, to celebrate and to keep working towards progress, just as there are reasons to be sad and angry and to use that energy to create change.We found a piece on good news in the New York Times that we want to share. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/22/opinion/the-best-news-you-dont-know.html?smprod=nytcore-ipad&amp;smid=nytcore-ipad-share&amp;_r=0\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Best News You Don&#x2019;t Know</em></a> points out the fact that 9 out of 10 Americans believe that global poverty has either worsened or stayed constant in the last twenty years. But the truth is that the number of people living in extreme poverty ($1.90 per person per day) has been cut in half since 1996.This isn&#x2019;t the only area that has improved&#x2013;child mortality rates have dropped, as have illiteracy rates and global inequality. In fact, today less than 10% of the world population is living in extreme poverty, down from 44% in 1981. And, the U.N. will come close to reaching its goal of completely eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.<strong>Optimistic, pessimistic, or realistic?</strong>The world is not perfect. Poverty, child mortality, illiteracy and inequality still exist and need our continued attention. But the article&#x2019;s author, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/column/nicholas-kristof?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Opinion&amp;module=ExtendedByline&amp;region=Header&amp;pgtype=article\" target=\"_blank\">Nicholas Kristof</a>, felt that it was important to acknowledge and celebrate the progress that humanity has achieved. Because if we never pause to take stock of our successes we won&#x2019;t be able to sustain the energy to push for further growth.We want to encourage you to not only seek out stories of collective growth and triumphs, but to look for areas in your own life where you have improved. Celebrate your incremental successes, acknowledge areas where you&#x2019;ve grown and feel confident knowing that you have the potential to change the world. Even though it&#x2019;s easy to focus on the negatives in life, sustain hope by reminding yourself of all of the the goodness.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Through&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.theyouschool.com/\" target=\"_blank\">YouSchool&#x2019;s</a>&#xA0;work with students alongside public high schools, one thing is clear&#x2014;the love language of school educators is spelled D-A-T-A. As one district leader told me, &#x201C;If you don&#x2019;t have data, you don&#x2019;t exist!&#x201D;Meausurements like GPA, school attendance, standardized test scores, graduation rates, and college acceptance, along with big ideas like Common Core Standards, dominate the conversations and mental models. Sweat, funding, resources, and success are focused on test scores and results. School districts bend much of what they do towards improving test scores, and to get there they&#x2019;ve designed almost automated, mechanistic systems to support as many students as possible.There is a growing consensus of well-respected K-12 educators agreeing that the current design of our system is falling short to help the next generation of students thrive. Many voices are emerging to suggest that applying one-size-fits-all approaches to dynamic, multi-dimensional people might be more scalable and efficient, but the strategy falls short of really helping students own their future, discover their true selves, and march forward with confidence into the right career.&#xA0;Those challenges are now compounded by exorbitant costs for college and it&#x2019;s making higher education unattainable for millions.Valerie Strauss, director of the scathing documentary&#xA0;<em>The Race to Nowhere</em>, talks about the unintended consequences of focusing exclusively on performance on test scores in a&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/is-this-really-what-education-is-about/2012/05/19/gIQAoEf4bU_blog.html\">Washington Post article</a>: &#x201C;Even for those students who stick with it, tests degrade the educational experience, fueling performance anxiety and the false impression that academic success is about speed, accuracy and competition.&#x201D; For all the emphasis on testing, there are millions of kids who are being left behind, and millions more who meet the educational requirements but are missing out on actual learning.&#xA0;<a href=\"http://sirkenrobinson.com/\">Sir Ken Robinson</a>&#xA0;famously said in one of his&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_how_to_escape_education_s_death_valley.html\">TED talks</a>, &#x201C;The dropout crisis is just the tip of an iceberg. What it doesn&#x2019;t count are all the kids who are in school but being disengaged from it, who don&#x2019;t enjoy it, who don&#x2019;t get any real benefit from it.&#x201D;With so much national attention on the public school system, and so much focus on data derived from standardized testing, we&#x2019;re noticing the glaring lack of attention spent on helping REAL people understand themselves and grow into self-aware human beings. How is it, that students can go through well over a decade of school, but not know what to do with their lives when they come out on the other side? Why don&#x2019;t students spend ONE class period, one day, or one week learning about themselves?We think every student deserves to have the opportunity to discover their full potential. We hope every student gains the self-awareness they need to understand who they really are, not just who they&#x2019;re expected to be. We want every student to gain the confidence they&#x2019;ll need to live authentically true to themselves. And we want every student to gain the life skills to author their own story and charge forward with courage.When one educator recently said to us, &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t see how helping students discover themselves would help us increase graduation rates,&#x201D; we realized that we have a challenge and an opportunity to redefine the&#xA0;<em>definition of success</em>&#xA0;for the public education system.&#xA0;Our common sense, human-centered approach to helping students discover the best version of themselves and live according to their potential is helping students own their lives, own their education, and get clear about the story they want to tell with their lives.Our big dream is to become ubiquitous alongside the education system, joining in with many other dynamic, innovative and thoughtful people and programs to help students own their stories and futures. Students need help discovering who they are, what makes them tick, become clear about their challenges and roadblocks, and get glimpses of how to put their passions and strengths to use. They need to see what it looks like to live life well, and have real conversations about real things. They need to be taught that no one else is responsible for their education or their future, and it&#x2019;s up to them to tell interesting, meaningful stories through their lives. They need help seeing why learning math, science, and english are relevant tools to become who they could at their best.What would it look like if we were developing a generation of emotionally aware and whole people, equipped with the right answers to the questions, and even more importantly on the right track for them to live their best lives? From valedictorians to students who are barely graduating, everyone deserves a better opportunity to discover who they truly are. Because it&#x2019;s possible to succeed in school, but fail in life.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "date":"November 06, 2014",
       "principle":"UNCOMMON",
       "content_body":"My husband and I will bring a new baby boy into the world in just a couple of months from today. As we&#x2019;ve been preparing for that moment, I&#x2019;ve been thinking about some of the things that I want to share with him from the very first moment he experiences the world. One of the things that struck me as essential is teaching him about the power of imagination, the ability to question and ask &#x201C;what if&#x201D; and to suspend traditional assumptions so that he can open his mind to the world of ultimate possibilities and ultimate play.Children are especially good at dreaming and imagining, so I doubt he&#x2019;ll have a problem catching on at first. Anybody who&#x2019;s spent much time with a child under the age of 5 will probably agree. The key will be helping him practice and hone his skills of imagination so that he can continue dreaming far into adulthood. Because if he&#x2019;s anything like me&#x2014;he&#x2019;ll probably have trouble tapping into his dreams when he&#x2019;s caught-up in life&#x2019;s hustle and bustle.It&#x2019;s my hope in sharing this letter that those of us who have reached adulthood might remember, if only for a moment, what it&#x2019;s like to be a young boy or girl. A child who hasn&#x2019;t yet set his or her boundaries&#x2014;whose mind is open to possibilities and whose imagination roams free.To My Son&#x2013;<strong>&#xA0;</strong>Imagine you built the very best forts in the neighborhood where all the kids come to play. Fifteen story forts handmade from the hand-hewn poplars that grow in our backyard and the hides from deer that drink in the nearby stream. Forts that stay lit long into the night with the light from fifty candles, a light so bright that people find their way from miles away and come to play every night.&#xA0;<strong>Imagine never letting big dreams deter you&#x2014;and rather than turning away from challenges other people call impossible, charging in head first with the determination that anything can be done.</strong>Imagine climbing the highest hill to see what your world looks like from a different perspective. And on the way that highest hill becomes the highest mountain where you have to find your way through dusty lowlands, wild forests and arid snowfields to reach your final destination. And the only food you have is what you can carry, but you know it will sustain you until you make it back home again. <strong>Imagine knowing that what you have is enough&#x2014;and always being able to turn inward to find the strength to keep going.</strong>Imagine walking as far as your feet will take you. Soon you are no longer walking close to home but dog sledding across Alaska. And along the sled ride, you come across hoards of bears that you have to wrestle to pass, followed by three Eskimos who give you a place to stay for the night and teach you how to make a bow which will protect you for the rest of your journey.&#xA0;<strong>Imagine treating everybody you meet along your path as a teacher, choosing to learn something from each and every interaction you have.</strong>Imagine going fishing on a pier. And that pier suddenly becomes a thirty-foot boat tossed about in rough seas in the depths of winter. It&#x2019;s your job to pull as many crab traps as possible before heading back to shore the next morning. You can barely feel your hands, but you keep pulling with all your force, and by sunrise count more crabs on your side of the boat than anybody else.&#xA0;<strong>Imagine welcoming adversity as a chance to push through your boundaries and discover a side of yourself that you never knew existed.</strong>Imagine you&#x2019;re on your way to school in a big yellow bus and that big yellow bus suddenly takes flight. Flying far above the clouds until you&#x2019;re soaring with eagles. And then that big yellow bus disappears altogether, your arms become wings and you fly among the eagles, leading all the other children in a dance of flips, summersaults and turns.&#xA0;<strong>Imagine assuming nobody else is watching you, and choosing your actions based on what speaks to your soul rather than what you think might make others happy. </strong>Imagine you&#x2019;re granted a pass to spend the night at the zoo all by yourself. But you aren&#x2019;t scared because you can talk to all the animals and they can talk to you. During the night you make friends with the lions who let you climb on their backs as they introduced you to their friends&#x2014;the panthers, the hippos, the tigers and the meerkats.<strong> Imagine letting your guard down when you least want to and through that vulnerability reaching places you never thought you&#x2019;d go.&#xA0;</strong>Imagine you&#x2019;re the star pitcher for your little league team. And in the bottom of the ninth, down by 10, your team ties the game and goes to extra innings. You pitch your heart out into the 15<sup>th</sup> inning, with speeds increasing until you pitch at 100mph. And then, in the 16th inning you come up to the plate with the bases loaded and sink one into deep left field. You round the bases to the cheers of friends and family, and get to eat as much ice cream as you want for the rest of the night.&#xA0;<strong>Imagine never letting up and never giving up hope&#x2014;instead choosing the knowledge that anything is possible.</strong>Imagine you wake up in the middle of the night to a fire alarm and have to run outside in your pajamas. And on that run, you begin your great escape. Out from the confines of your neighborhood and into the middle of New York City. You grab a motorcycle and started zipping around the city&#x2014;exploring the empty midnight streets by the light of the tall buildings beside you.<strong>&#xA0;Imagine knowing that every bump in the road is simply a signal to look left and look right&#x2014;and see all the other opportunities around you.</strong>Imagine you&#x2019;re a scuba diver who travels the world to find the very best diving spots. But, one time you decide not to come back up and instead swim deeper to find your home at the bottom of the ocean for a year. During this year you swim with dolphins and make friends with sharks. You learn to speak the language of the ocean and orchestrate schools of fish to dance with you.&#xA0;<strong>Imagine being free to always choose a path that&#x2019;s different&#x2014;a path that&#x2019;s guided by your own passions, interests and ingenuity. &#xA0;</strong>For you my son&#x2014;I imagine all this and more. I imagine the thoughts you&#x2019;ll have, the worlds you&#x2019;ll create and the places you&#x2019;ll explore from your very own mind. But what thrills me the most is imagining the amazing things you&#x2019;ll imagine&#x2014;the dreams you&#x2019;ll dream, the places your heart will lead you, and the passions that will drive you wild. Life is nothing if not an opportunity to imagine and I can&#x2019;t wait to see you tackle it head on.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Living in the moment&#x2014;something we all wish we did a little more. Aside from being a great way to relish the world around us, living in the moment can fuel creativity. For over the past 30 years Western psychology has been playing catch-up with Eastern spirituality and the concept of mindfulness. Mindfulness is a mental state where people attain a complete sense of openness by focusing on the present by attempting to ignore regrets or hang-ups about the past and not worrying about the future. Harnessed properly it can fuel creativity, reduce stress, raise IQ levels, enable people to appreciate the small things, and act cool under pressure by untangling their thoughts.How can you put mindfulness in operation? Well, a little history lesson first.&#xA0; Mindfulness was one of the original teachings of the Buddha. It&#x2019;s considered one of the seven factors of enlightenment. Buddha believed living with mindfulness day to day, culminated to wisdom. Since the &#x2018;80s, the world&#x2019;s leading medical researchers and scientists have been applying these principals to psychology. It has been adapted from Buddhist meditation practices for treatment of depression and anxiety. By focusing personal experience on the present, worries or anxiety of the past and/or future simply fade away. Senses become more heightened, enabling people to view the world with curiosity and flexibility.Although meditation can be effective to un-clutter the mind, there are other mindfulness techniques to be used separately to strengthen abilities to access one&#x2019;s unconscious and be more creative. It can be a simple technique: get into a comfortable space, relax or close the eyes, and concentrate on the &#x201C;in&#x201D; breath and then the &#x201C;out&#x201D; breath. It&#x2019;s an exercise that doesn&#x2019;t allow the mind wander and focuses on the present state of mind.In my experience as a graphic designer, mindfulness has allowed me to stop and think (or not think), not be overwhelmed by attempts to better my previous work, or focus on the crippling anxiety of creating &#x201C;the next great thing.&#x201D; It has allowed me to just enjoy being in the midst of the creative design process.Modern mindfulness is a mental state where people can cultivate a sense of openness, awareness and focus. In business it can be a great ally in stressful situations as we don&#x2019;t worry about the future or the past and remain alert and calm. Joshua Aronson, a psychologist at NYU, says, &#x201C; Some studies show that people who do mindfulness meditation gain as much as 10 IQ points.&#x201D; He continues, &#x201C;It works on the ability to screen out irrelevant information, to clear out the mind of distractions, and to focus intently on relevant stimuli, which frees up resources to solve problems.&#x201D;Bringing attention to the present experience through mindfulness frees the mind of mental chatter. When the mind is relaxed and focused on the present you think differently. Thinking on autopilot, or what Buddhists call &#x201C;Monkey Mind,&#x201D; is a bad habit one can perpetuate. Through mindfulness we can filter out extraneous information and set the stage for accessing the creative unconscious. The unconscious is the well of experiences that inform and inspire spontaneous inspiration. Psychologist Cheryl Arutt says, &#x201C;I am continually amazed at the work of the unconscious in the minds of creative artists. The capacity to hold many details in the conscious, wakeful mind may seem limited; the unconscious is capable of holding far more.&#x201D;Of course creative thought is more than clearing the mind and hoping that brilliance strikes like a bolt out of the blue. In my personal experience creativity is something that is earned through experiences in daily life. Creativity requires dedicated practice of being interested in the world around us and acting on those interests to arrive at new insights.Use mindfulness to empower yourself to arrive at more creative solutions with a clear mind. Living in the moment is getting tougher with us becoming more plugged in every day. Avoid the dreaded Monkey Mind and make life more fulfilling.More resources located at the following sites:<br> <a href=\"http://www.mindfulness.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.mindfulness.com/</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.mindfulnet.org/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.mindfulnet.org/</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.mindfulnesstapes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.mindfulnesstapes.com/</a><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"It&#x2019;s a common refrain, young and old, people everywhere talk about wanting more out of life&#x2014;more impact, more opportunity, more fit, more balance&#x2014;just more. And more often than not, the longing for more is tied to career. But what <em>more </em>should look like, where to find greater fulfillment, too often remains undefined. As a result, rather than moving forward with intent, many people fail to fulfill their potential, not because of lack of ability, means, or opportunity, but because very few can even say what they want.The inability of incredibly intelligent, successful, highly competent, and otherwise articulate individuals to simply say what they want is staggering. The rambling stream of unconnected gibberish that follows the phrase &#x201C;I want something more&#x201D; is painful to hear. Even worse, the failure to say what they want oftentimes results in extremely capable people who are not fulfilling their potential either professionally or personally.<strong>What stops people from moving forward?</strong>It&#x2019;s not lack of ability. People spend tremendous amounts of time managing things: Strategic plans, corporate reorganization, the Little League snack and carpool schedule. And yet, when it comes to managing our careers and charting our life&#x2019;s journey, too many of us <em>can&#x2019;t find the time</em>. But it is time that must be spent. Placing value on ourselves is not a selfish act. And putting everyone and everything else first is not heroic. Remember the airplane safety drill: &#x201C;Secure your mask before helping others.&#x201D; When you take the time to make yourself stronger, you will be better able to help those around you.With some introspection and a bit of unfiltered soul searching, you can learn to understand your skills, values, and passion as part of an exercise to articulate what makes you different, better, and special in the world. It&#x2019;s the first step toward learning to tell your story in a powerful way.Being a great storyteller is about more than simply telling a story. It&#x2019;s about being compelling. It&#x2019;s about being inspirational. It&#x2019;s about having a hook that makes people want to listen from the beginning straight through to the end. It&#x2019;s about having heart. And conviction. And the courage to put yourself and what you believe in for others to see. Finding your truth is the first step in learning to say what you want.But knowing what to do isn&#x2019;t enough. It won&#x2019;t make you start. To do that, take these two uncommon steps to set you on your journey.<strong>First, set a deadline.</strong> Note the word. Dead. Line. It has an irrefutable ending, and it suggests a direction. Set a date to complete your plan. It won&#x2019;t happen overnight, so give yourself time. It may be three months, it may be six. Be realistic, but be specific. Then, share it with a friend. Pick someone who will keep you honest and call you out if you don&#x2019;t follow through. Someone who is bossy and whom you trust will fill the bill.<strong>Second, write it down.</strong> All of it, the deadline, your goals, your skills, values, passion. Take pen to paper or fingers to keyboard and begin to bring your plan into the world. Create a document that stares at you, challenges you, gets in your face, and pushes you to bring your talents to bear for your most meaningful project of all&#x2014;you. Then share that with your same bossy, trusted friend. Together, you can test it for authenticity and take ownership of accountability. Finding two to three people to join your team is even better.With a deadline and a commitment to creating a tangible plan, you will be taking action rather than merely hiding behind those words that pine for more. A deliberate effort to tell your story, to say what you want to accomplish with your life, exactly what getting more out of life means to you, is not always an easy thing. But it&#x2019;s incredibly important. In fact, it&#x2019;s pretty much <em>the</em> thing.As you become comfortable telling your story, your confidence will grow like a muscle and will become stronger as you exercise it. Armed with clarity of vision, a sense of your own purpose, and a commitment to persevere, you will gain strength from knowing what matters most to you and why. Taking the time for yourself will empower you to pursue a life that is meaningful and will enable you to reach toward more and to add greater value.Mask in place, you will be ready to claim your unique place in the world.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"This November, a massive three-day gathering of creatives took place in San Diego, Ca&#x2014;downtown streets were filled with 10,000 matching tote bags, lunch conversations critiquing menu designs, and hype surrounding Quentin Tarantino&#x2019;s upcoming appearance at the event. Of course, people didn&#x2019;t go to <a href=\"http://max.adobe.com/\">Adobe MAX</a> only for the tote bags (although they didn&#x2019;t hurt), they went to hear from design leaders, learn about tips and tricks for Adobe products they used everyday and meet other creatives from around the world.&#xA0;As one of those &#x201C;creatives&#x201D;, being surrounded by masses of people, discovering art installations around every corner and running into some of my design heroes in the corridors of the conference hall left me with an overwhelmingly sense of inspiration. The feeling is similar to when you drink an excessive amount of coffee, causing you to think a mile a minute only to freeze in place not knowing quite where to start.

       "content_body":"We believe there is truly something magical about working with our hands. Creating brings us into a world of honesty and humility, pride and passion. It evokes an undeniable reality that demands individual attention and creativity. Using our hands to create something&#x2014;anything&#x2014;instills a sense of self, giving us a realization of what can and cannot be controlled. It is incredibly inspiring and empowering.Sharing handmade creations is one of the most thoughtful gifts one can give. If you&#x2019;ve ever received something that someone took the time to craft with their hands, you understand.We had the privilege of talking to a craftsman who is using his hands to create something beautiful for the purpose of gifting. Pete Jorgensen, a retired paramedic, builder and woodworker from Tucson, AZ is the father of <a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/who-we-are#brett-jorgensen\" target=\"_blank\">Brett Jorgensen</a>, one of Bulldog Drummond&#x2019;s lead designers. Pete has been working with wood since he was a young lad in his father&#x2019;s custom cabinet shop. James Jorgensen was a perfectionist and a kind, patient teacher who led by example and taught his children to appreciate the craft of woodworking.&#x201C;Looking back, I bet he had to correct things later that we did while &#x2018;helping him&#x2019; on his wood working projects.&#x201D; said Pete. He recalls his dad loving the creative process of exploring a customer&#x2019;s idea and the challenge of bringing their vision to life. His goal was simple, to make quality cabinets that pleased his clients. Today, Pete has adopted this simple but important philosophy in his own work.&#xA0;<br><br> It was more than cabinets. Cabinets paid the bills but Pete&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s passion was in the creative process. Pete watched his father enjoy the challenge of working with wood, exploring his creativity and making things that made people happy. When Brett was born, Grandpa Jim made him a small rocking chair that has been passed down through the family. Pete recalls his father turning Christmas ornaments on the lathe along with elaborate sewing cabinets and beautifully turned bowls for family gifts. The passion was clearly in the making and giving.<strong>Passion runs in the family</strong>Pete retired ten years ago, but he hasn&#x2019;t slowed down. Aside from large jobs like remodels, cabinets and furniture-making, he enjoys experimenting with small wood projects&#x2014;one of those projects being baby rattles.&#xA0;He started making baby rattles on his lathe when a few friends announced they were having grandchildren. Carrying on his father&#x2019;s tradition of making handmade gifts, Pete&#x2019;s goal is to make something that will not only be useful to a baby but can be passed down as a family treasure. As he so aptly says, &#x201C;I think I will always have the need to create with my hands.&#x201D;&#xA0;<strong>It&#x2019;s all about the process</strong>Pete keeps the process simple. He repurposes almost all of the wood he uses to make the rattles. He uses a small, traditional lathe and allows each rattle to evolve naturally depending on the personality of the wood, each taking about 30 minutes to an hour to turn and resulting in a different shape and color. They occasionally break but Pete says the trick is to carve out the rings on the rattle carefully before cutting them away from the base. After the rattle is turned, it&#x2019;s sanded and then finished with vegetable oil so it&#x2019;s safe for babies to play with and chew. The oiling process also brings out the colors in the wood adding to each rattles uniqueness. As the final step, Pete tests each rattle to ensure a good sound and checks for soft edges for baby&#x2019;s little hands.&#xA0;<strong>Keeping the passion alive</strong>&#xA0;When James wasn&#x2019;t healthy enough to go to his cabinet shop anymore, he set up a table in his living room and began building small balsa wood airplanes, boats and cars. Grandma Lou wasn&#x2019;t happy about the wood shavings all over the floor, so when she kicked him out of the living room, Pete and his brothers built a small workshop in his backyard where he moved his projects.&#xA0; &#xA0;Pete dreams of the same scenario&#x2014;growing old in a small workshop while creating and pursuing his passion projects. He says,&#x201C;I think I will be like my dad, trying to find ways to continue to design and create as long as my hands work! It brings me such satisfaction to do the work and to make others happy.&#x201D;Clearly the passion to create runs in the Jorgensen family. Stories like Pete&#x2019;s serve as a reminder to explore simple passions and enjoy the process along the way. We encourage you to explore that hobby you used to love as a child or learn a new skill, maybe even a woodworking project. Build a model plane like James or learn to <a href=\"http://www.instructables.com/id/Your-First-Robot/\">build a robot</a>. Take on that passion project you&#x2019;ve been putting off&#x2014;and tell us about it.&#xA0;<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

We&#x2019;d been high in the back country and hadn&#x2019;t seen a soul. As we were coming back to our truck we saw eight Harleys and their accompanying leather and chain clad gang of bearded bikers ominously milling around. They looked tough from a distance in all black and it got me thinking, why do we make instant judgments about groups of people who are different than us based on appearance? We&#x2019;re all a little quick to judge books by their covers.The closer we got to the group, the more leather and chains we could see but as we got within earshot, one of them asked if I could take a photo of the group. That was my invitation and out came the banter&#x2014;they wanted to know if I was Australian, if the could take a photo of me on one of their bikes, and we all had a good chuckle. Then&#xA0;I noticed they were all wearing the same &#x201C;Bikers Against Child Abuse&#x201D; badge.&#xA0;So I asked lots of questions, like if they&#x2019;d been abused, and the amazing story of complete kindness they told was a lesson in never judging books by their covers. They offer a protective service to children who have been abused, and have a very clear mission:<a href=\"http://bacaworld.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Bikers Against Child Abuse </a>(BACA) exists with the intent to create a safer environment for abused children. We exist as a body of Bikers to empower&#xA0;children to not feel afraid of the world in which they live. We stand ready to lend support to our wounded friends by involving them with an established,&#xA0;united organization. We work in conjunction with local and state officials who are already in place to protect children. We desire to send a clear message to&#xA0;all involved with the abused child that this child is part of our organization, and that we are prepared to lend our physical and emotional support to them by&#xA0;affiliation, and our physical presence. We stand at the ready to shield these children from further abuse.<strong>I particularly enjoyed this: </strong>We do not condone the use of violence or physical&#xA0;force in any manner, however, if circumstances arise such that we are the only obstacle preventing a child from further abuse, we stand ready to be that&#xA0;obstacle.Hoosier Daddy?<strong>UNCOMMON SENSE OBSERVATIONS</strong><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

Likewise a brand vision paints a succinct and competitive picture of why the brand exists. It helps illustrate how they see the future as a result of their influence on it, helping them raise money, attract talent and kick-start momentum. <a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/brands-are-like-people-and-people-are-like-brands\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Brands are like people</a>, and without purpose they can drift aimlessly.Len Forkas, athlete and founder of Hopecam shares how tunnel vision has helped him reach his goals and offers advice to use this focused vision to stay focused and achieve his mission.When what lies in front of you is an uphill road, take a cue from ultra-endurance athlete Len Forkas. Len learned to filter out the negatives when his body is pushed to its absolute limits. In an interview with the Wisdom Capture team, he recalls a recent struggle: <em>&#x201C;I raced a bicycle 3,000 miles across the United States in 11 days. I went over 180,000 vertical feet in hill. Across the Rockies, across the Ozarks, and across the Appalachian Mountains.&#x201D;</em><br><br>Len describes: <em>&#x201C;They were times when I was going up a hugely steep hill. Five miles going uphill, and there were times when I just didn&#x2019;t look up. I just looked down, and I just kept pedaling the bicycle. And I realized that oftentimes there are moments when you have to filter out all the negatives, which was the fact that that hill seemed endless. You look down, and you stay focused, stay in the moment, and keep pushing pedals.&#x201D;</em>When you stay focused and stay dedicated to your (tunnel) vision, a wonderful thing happens. <br><em>&#x201C;Sure enough, eventually, my most favorite sign of all the street signs is a picture of a truck on a big black wedge of cheese, because that means my hill is done. I&#x2019;ve got a downhill coming. I think the lesson taught in that is sometimes you have to just look down, hunker down, and just keep moving.&#x201D;</em><iframe class=\"wistia_embed\" title=\"Wistia video player\" src=\"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/vaooa5v3m7?videoFoam=true\" name=\"wistia_embed\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>If your vision isn&#x2019;t clear, and if your team isn&#x2019;t talking about the impact your brand is trying to make in the world, then it&#x2019;s time to revisit it. The vision should be a clear statement that paints a picture of how you want to see the world changed based on your brand&#x2019;s role in it. The vision should be big and bold. It should be a stretch, thought-provoking and inspiring. People need a paycheck and a career path, but they also want to be a part of something bigger&#x2013;&#x2013;have a clear vision and you will bring clarity to your brand.&#xA0;<em>Read more from <a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/author/wisdom-capture#filters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wisdom Capture</a> and explore their <a href=\"https://app.wisdomcapture.com/v/1/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">leadership videos</a>.</em><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

Do you make your voice heard? Do you go against the grain? Or do you simply follow the crowd?Oftentimes it depends on the situation. Consider a situation where the majority of those around you are in alliance and you simply cannot agree. Business leaders face this situation everyday as it relates to cultural issues, budgets, mergers and acquisitions and more.&#xA0;We recently read an <a href=\"http://komonews.com/archive/ballards-macefield-house-a-lot-of-symbolism-for-a-little-house\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> by Hanna Brooks Olsen talking about the real &#x201C;Up&#x201D; story. The Disney Pixar collaboration about the story of Carl Fredricksen, a 78-year-old balloon salesman who is about to fulfill a lifelong dream. The story was inspired by a true story that occurred in 2006. Edith Macefield refused to sell her home to developers. They wanted it so badly that they offered her $1M. She refused to sell so, the developers built around her house.Macefield is an example of standing for what you believe regardless of the pressure or prevailing wind. Oftentimes we see people (and brands) pandering to trends and the path of least resistance. They don&#x2019;t have the courage to take a stance and do something appropriately different. But to be authentic, it&#x2019;s necessary to remain true to your core values.Sometimes standing your ground can be difficult.

       "content_body":"It&#x2019;s not easy to act upon an idea. When I launched DEFINE, I began with an image, followed by a deep brainstorming session, a few frustrations, and eventually a business plan, logo and website. I&#x2019;m sure the picture painted is very similar to what most entrepreneurs experience. There&#x2019;s a lack of something&#x2014;a void or a need&#x2014;and as entrepreneurs it annoys the hell out of us, until one night we awake suddenly from our sleep with a (seemingly) viable solution. The next day we&#x2019;re thrilled to present the answer to the masses and hope it&#x2019;s what the people are actually looking for.<br> <br> It&#x2019;s a bit embarrassing to admit, but the truth is I thought the hardest work would come in the initial building and birthing of my new business, an online photography school. Little did I know that the hardest work would come after the people started to show up at my door. The need to stay fresh, innovative, and invoke forward thinking was quietly, but evidently, expected. People are attracted to new companies, but what keeps people around is how those companies continue to re-invent themselves in a relevant way.<br> <br> I&#x2019;m certainly not complaining about the fact that my business has taken off rather quickly, but I can&#x2019;t deny the fact that it&#x2019;s also been terrifying. I created an answer to a problem and when the work became too much for just me, I started to hire more teachers and more support staff. Today, just over a year in, my team exists of 20 brilliant minds.<br> <br> I don&#x2019;t recall much from college, but there are a few one-liners from specific teachers that will be etched into my brain forever. One of those lines is this: The problem with our school systems is that there are a group of adults sitting in a room talking about their ideas on how to make things better. If you want to make things better, ask the kindergarten teachers.<br> <br> I&#x2019;ve implemented this idea with DEFINE by not just having staff meetings in which we brainstorm new ideas for growth. Yes, these types of meetings are important (if done right), but what has become the biggest source for growth are the surveys we send out to our students just after a block of classes has wrapped up. The key is that the questions are few and they are answered anonymously.<br> <br> I&#x2019;ll admit that my least favorite email to get is the one labeled, &#x201C;[Month&#x2019;s] Survey Results.&#x201D; Sometimes I open it immediately and other times I wait a few days. This is because even though majority of the comments are enthusiastic and positive, there are always a good number of comments that sting. And of course, as the founder, my work is my love child. If you tell me my baby is pretty minus his ugly toes, I am only going to walk away thinking about his unfortunate looking toes.<br> <br> At this point you may be wondering, &#x201C;then why set yourself up to be told your baby has ugly toes?&#x201D;. We should clearly just lock ourselves in our offices and create work that we think is good and pretend as if everyone else agrees. If they don&#x2019;t, it&#x2019;s their loss.<br> <br> Obviously, this is ludicrous. And prideful. And a reason why many new companies crash and burn.<br> <br> So, I read the results and I cringe and I sometimes overact and convince myself that this whole thing is going to go down in flames the next day. And then I put on my big girl pants and I make a list of ways we can improve, additional training we can implement for teachers, ways we can communicate to our community in a more seamless manner, design elements we can add to make our website better&#x2026; and the list goes on.<br> <br> And this is why the email I dread the most has been one of the biggest sources for growth for my business. We simply created a space for our customers to be heard and then we use it to fuel our business forward.<br> <br> I&#x2019;m fully aware this idea is not new or even unusual, but I believe it to be one of the most underutilized tools amongst businesses&#x2014;big and small. If you don&#x2019;t currently have a way to get raw and honest feedback from your customers, no matter what field you are in or product you are selling, a good question to ask yourself is why.<br> <br> Offering a place for customers to tell you about areas of your business that are flawed is certainly not an easy pill to swallow, but if you&#x2019;re willing to gulp it down and listen up I can tell you from experience that it will catapult your business forward.&#xA0;<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Pen to paper, foot to pavement, someone woke up at four in the morning ready to change themselves, the world, or something in between. They are the 15-year old tech CEO who found an accurate, inexpensive technique of detecting pancreatic cancer. They are the late-blooming artist who begins painting starry nights in their late twenties. They are the ubiquitous tech-entrepreneur who refuses to listen to naysayers. What lies at the heart of their stories is the same&#x2014;they have decided to curate their own story and cultivate a passion for living life. The words of Blake Mycoskie always come to mind when people speak of curation:&#x201C;If you organize your life around your passion, you can turn your passion into your story and then turn your story into something bigger&#x2014;something that matters.&#x201D;There is a lot of buzz around curation, both arguing against and applauding the dissemination and ubiquity of a concept that was, until recently, reserved for art galleries and museums. The Bourgeois need not apply. Like most English words, the term &#x201C;curate&#x201D; has evolved many times since its conception, and in its current form comes from the Medieval Latin term &#x201C;cura,&#x201D; which means to take care or cure of souls. People are taking care of their souls in order to find passion in life. All linguistic and artistic egos aside, I hope the word becomes as ubiquitous as possible. We are quenching a thirst for meaning in life and catalyzing our passions with the rapid cultural transformation we have instigated with the invention of the Internet. People pursue interests with the same ardor as a museum curator or a parish priest fighting for the souls of her flock. We have more ability. We have a world of information at our fingertips, and an unprecedented number of choices we can make in a day. The Internet is just a tool, inanimate and void of emotion or decision-making capabilities. We must learn to harness this tool and tend to our increasingly complex lives. Curation outside of the museum is imperative.There&#x2019;s nothing more important than the inherent tension in life&#x2014;the struggle to find oneself in a world of happiness and corruption, in perfection and poverty. The dualistic struggle to comprehend ourselves drives us to very personal expressions and occupations, all creative in their own right, and all worthy of curation. Our wake-up time, jobs, habits, vices, and brands all reflect this tension. By curating your own life, you have an ability to find peace and passion in life, individually and collectively. I associate curation with something I call Zensanity&#x2014;making a habit out of cultivating a desire for something people think is insane, and deciding every day to do something that gets you closer to said insanity. It&#x2019;s a Buddhist thing. The important thing to remember is that the goal&#xA0;is not the end result, but the desire to get there. It&#x2019;s the curating of life that brings you happiness. The goal is mindfulness.I grew up without much money, supervision or food. I had a rough go of life when I was younger, and yet I would only change a few things if I had the chance. The experiences I&#x2019;ve had shaped me into the person I am today. I have empathy for people, and try to metaphorically walk in others&#x2019; shoes daily. When I was nine-years old I started writing and sketching my thoughts in a journal, and never would have imagined I&#x2019;d be in the position I am today&#x2014;looking out of my window at a picturesque view of the Chicago skyline&#x2014;I didn&#x2019;t even know my ABCs. Fortunately, my narrative leads me to becoming a designer: to connecting with a desire to produce positive visual communication and art; to thinking of new brands with positive social benefits; and to writing this article. I do my best to curate my life&#x2014;it&#x2019;s just as important to me as any museum piece.My senior year of high school, a mentor of mine asked if we could meet at our favorite lunch spot. She asked how I was doing, what universities I was considering, and how my family situation was working out. At the end of our visit, she slipped me a hundred dollar bill and asked if I could do something for her. Clutching the crisp Benjamin, I made a promise to do whatever she needed. She asked me to &#x201C;never lose my naivety. Never lose the wonder.&#x201D; She told me how she wished someone had told her those words when she was getting started in life. At the time, I didn&#x2019;t know her advice would become both the basis of my happiness in my private and professional life, and the foundation for making my life personal.Life is personal. Curate it.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"As an executive recruiter, or, headhunter as some prefer, I have had the opportunity to be engaged with hundreds of companies across diverse industries. Many companies strive to have a highly unique culture and desire candidates who will be a &#x201C;fit&#x201D; in their organizations. I believe it&#x2019;s a mutual exploration process between candidate and potential employer. As part of my company&#x2019;s interview process when vetting prospective candidates, we always explore motivation. What motivates this individual not only professionally but personally? How does he or she motivate others? To truly understand if this candidate will be a good fit, we listen to, and ensure we understand, their intrinsic motivations and leadership skills.&#xA0;<strong>The art of leader motivation<br></strong>Leadership is creating conditions in which people want to follow the leader. Motivation is described as &#x201C;an energizing force that stimulates arousal, direction, and persistence of behavior&#x201D;. Successful leaders show that the outcomes are what the followers want for themselves. Followers believe that they share the same values, and as a result, are self-motivation to follow the leader.<em>&#x201C;Our chief want is someone who will inspire us to be what we know we could be.&quot; &#xA0;</em><em>&#x2013;</em>Ralph Waldo Emerson<strong>People&#x2019;s level of motivation is driven by self-talk<br></strong>Not everyone is self-motivated to complete all aspects of their professional endeavors. Learning techniques to motivate oneself are as equally important as learning how to motivate others. Self-talk is the spoken and internal message we communicate to ourselves about our feelings and attitudes. While there is no one size fits all technique to enhance self-motivation, negative messages can impact risk taking while positive messages provide stimulus for accomplishing goals. Start with the belief that every obstacle is an opportunity.<em>&quot;In everyone&apos;s life, at some time, our inner fire goes out. It is then burst into flames by an encounter with another human being. We should all be thankful for those people who rekindle the inner spirit.&quot;&#xA0;</em>&#x2013;Albert Schweitzer<strong>Personal goals + professional goals = motivation to succeed<br></strong>How many companies embrace personal life-goal planning for employees in conjunction with professional goals and objectives? Our business lives and personal lives are not separate, they&#x2019;re intertwined. Life planning includes professional and personal objectives that are often co-dependent on each other. For example, the goal of having a family and buying a home may not be achieved without achieving professional goals that provide the compensation to achieve the personal goals.&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;When employees link personal goals to company goals they are more motivated to achieve the company goals because they see them as an extension of their own personal goals. Why not link these together in the workplace? Leaders who value the personal goals of their team members understand the importance of allowing employees to grow within and outside of the business. Personal goals can serve as motivation for employees to be more productive and successful. Accounting for the whole interests of a person will yield higher employee satisfaction, retention rates and more value.<em>&quot;The simple act of paying positive attention to people has a great deal to do with productivity.&#x201D; </em>&#x2013;Tom Peters<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

As a leader, you&#x2019;re under a new level of pressure in this&#xA0;new&#xA0;operating environment.<br><br>The U.S Army War College introduced the idea of <a href=\"http://www.carlisle.army.mil/orgs/SSL/dclm/pubs/slp3.pdf\">VUCA</a> at the end of&#xA0;the Cold War to define the volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous&#xA0;multilateral world that we now operate in. Add in constant digital disruption&#xA0;and&#xA0;that&#x2019;s when you can get VUC&#x2019;D.<br><br>Working alongside leaders of both multi-billion dollar organizations&#xA0;and early stage startups, we help them to examine the consequences, and anticipate&#xA0;and manage the impact of this VUC&#x2019;D world. The business categories they&#xA0;operate&#xA0;in are changing constantly and the leadership principles built on&#xA0;anticipation, preparedness and adaptability have never been more relevant.&#xA0;Leaders today must be masters of situational awareness and have&#xA0;a high EQ to manage businesses and guide teams through the new business climate&#xA0;change that we are experiencing. With the one-touch, empowered&#xA0;consumer who has 24/7&#xA0;access to instant information, peer-to-peer reviews, greater selection,&#xA0;convenience and value, almost every established business category has been (or is in&#xA0;the process of being) VUC&#x2019;D.<br><br>Meet the VUC&#x2019;Rs. The digital natives and the category disruptors&#xA0;who, like jujitsu masters, are rewriting the rules of every category. The&#xA0;founders of these brands see where the consumer is underserved, understand the&#xA0;impact of the inefficiencies and inconveniences, have identified the glaring gaps&#xA0;and where the untapped value hides, and they are delivering a radical new solution to&#xA0;disrupt a category or create a new one. Think Amazon, Airbnb,&#xA0;UBER, Snapchat and Stitchfix to name but a few. They are operationally excellent, agile, strategic&#xA0;and know how to deploy teams. They understand the powerful equation of&#xA0;convenience, value, service and empowerment and&#xA0;how to execute. Decisively. If&#xA0;your brand has become complacent or tired, look around for the VUC&#x2019;R in your&#xA0;category.&#xA0;Do you know who they are? What are they doing that you can learn from? How are they changing your category and customer expectations? How should you adapt?<br><br>General Stanley McChrystal&#x2019;s book, <a href=\"https://mcchrystalgroup.com/teamofteams/\">Team of Teams</a> outlines some&#xA0;incredibly practical principles on how to operate in today&#x2019;s ever-changing&#xA0;environment. It&#x2019;s a reminder of how imperative&#xA0;tools like common sense, data-driven&#xA0;insights,&#xA0;design thinking and clear communication are when dealing with complex&#xA0;challenges. When you&#x2019;re pinned down in the middle of the fight and taking flak&#xA0;on all fronts, it&#x2019;s easy to look past these brilliant basics. While&#xA0;nothing can&#xA0;fully prepare leaders for, or prevent the effects of such a volatile climate, these Uncommon Principles will remind us to:<br><br><strong>1. FRAME THE MISSION</strong><br>Identify the enemy, whether it&#x2019;s an inefficiency, complacency or a competitor.&#xA0;Define the problem you&#x2019;re going to solve.<br><br><strong>2. ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS&#xA0;</strong><br>Leaders don&#x2019;t have to be the smartest people in the room, but they do have&#xA0;to ask the right questions and create the space for others to thrive.<br><br><strong>3.&#xA0;DATA IS KEY, BUT INSIGHTS TELL STORIES&#xA0;</strong><br>Make sure you&#x2019;re paying attention to the right indicators. Turn data&#xA0;into insights that tell a story, keep your head up and pay attention to the&#xA0;world outside.<br><br><strong>4. USE SIMPLICITY LIKE A SUPER POWER</strong><br>Complexity is like a business cancer. It creates layers of people,&#xA0;time and cost. Examine every area of your business and ask why we do it this&#xA0;way. Redesign for the agile and simplified way.<br><br><strong>5. CRAWL. WALK. RUN.&#xA0;</strong><br>Move too fast and you will likely crash and burn. Move too slow and&#xA0;you will get crushed. The mantra of Crawl. Walk. Run. keeps it real.<br><br><strong>6. &#xA0;DIGITAL IS JUST FOR STARTERS</strong><br>If you don&#x2019;t understand the power of digital or you&#x2019;re discounting its power to disrupt your business, you&#x2019;re going to get VUC&#x2019;D.&#xA0;<strong>7. AND DON&#x2019;T FOGET, IT&#x2019;S NOT ALL ABOUT YOU&#xA0;</strong><br>Put the customer at the center of every decision you make and every&#xA0;solution you design for and you won&#x2019;t go too far wrong. And that means you really do&#xA0;have to know who your customer is. <span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Taylor Swift is an excellent example of how humility can lead to success. She&#x2019;s genuine. She connects and relates to her audience through her own experiences. She&#x2019;s inoffensive, but above all, she&#x2019;s humble. Almost too humble at times&#x2014;check out her reactions to winning her numerous awards. Steady Taylor. Don&#x2019;t lose your sincerity or everything might change.<br><br>Today she&#x2019;s the queen of humility, and it&#x2019;s working. She&#x2019;s sold 16 million albums worldwide on the back of her openness, honesty and relatability through her songwriting. But Taylor needs to stay true to herself and her fans as her career progresses. She broke the mold as the first real superstar who came to notoriety through the social network revolution. She&#x2019;s a poster child for millions, and for the new music business model. She wears her young heart on her sleeve and exposes her feelings in everything she does. And now, through her values and personality, she is a true, purposeful and extremely recognizable brand.<br><br>But does she have the staying power? Can she be Dove or Olay for generations to come?<br><br>The honesty and humility at the heart of brand-Swift is her biggest asset, and if nurtured, is what will help her sustain her career. And because these pillars are rooted in authenticity, she has the power to become relevant as she ages with her fans. Taylor&#x2019;s pinned on a million tween and teen girls&#x2019; walls (and some boys too) because through her lyrics, her stories resonate with them. At the same time, she&#x2019;s an aspirational example. Some might say that the biggest danger she faces is her own inner self. She&#x2019;s saving herself. She doesn&#x2019;t drink. She doesn&#x2019;t smoke, do drugs or reveal much of her body. Of course as time goes on, she might give way to one or two of these. The caution, and the opportunity, is for her to understand the powerful connection she&#x2019;s made with her fans, and the challenge is staying relevant to their life-stage.<br><br>Think about it, this is a new trend. Artists have never been able to forge connections with their fans to the degree that they can today. Sure there&#x2019;s still some sparkle surrounding today&#x2019;s heroines and heroes&#x2014;that will always be there in the eyes of fans. But there&#x2019;s another dimension too. Superstars are no longer untouchable and mythical beings. They blog. They tweet. They have two-way dialog with their fans. They publish the progress of their daily errands. Bummer, they&#x2019;re real like the rest of us. And whatever the artist doesn&#x2019;t expose, someone else will. There&#x2019;s no mystery surrounding icons like Taylor. Those days are long gone, there are no cover-ups or secrets anymore. It&#x2019;s all out there for everyone to see, and this new era makes it even more difficult for artists to sustain their success. In the old days sustained success was almost wholly built on the quality of their work and their record label&#x2019;s marketing efforts. Now that&#x2019;s only half of the equation.<br><br>Taylor&#x2019;s humility makes her attractive. But it also makes her vulnerable, and as she grows up, she&#x2019;ll be an easy target. We say stick close to the personal values you started with, and continue to forge that connection with your fans. You have permission to grow, and it&#x2019;s your humble and honest approach that will keep you grounded. As a celebrity brand, you&#x2019;re extendable. But be courageous in your humility, avoid the formulaic scent, clothing, and home furnishings deals and do something surprising with the permission you&#x2019;ve created. We dare you Swift, surprise us. Take it steady, and you&#x2019;ll be with us for a very long time.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"We live in a world that is perpetually <em>going</em>. There seems to be an enormous amount of cultural pressure to always be moving, always be producing, to always go, go, go. Work is just one piece of that. We are pressured not only to be wholly devoted to our work but also to be the best version of ourselves&#x2014;to be fit with a kick-ass body, to be the best parent with the kid on the fast track to an Ivy League, and to somehow manage to be happy in the midst of it all. While &#x201C;work&#x201D; might feel like the only four-letter word that matters, the world we live in has made &#x201C;stop&#x201D; one too. We could all use a lesson on how to slow down, stop and just breathe.<strong>The dis-</strong><strong>ease of being busy<br></strong>In his <em>On Being</em> column, Omid Safi described our collective inability to slow down as <a href=\"http://www.onbeing.org/blog/the-disease-of-being-busy/7023\">&#x201C;The Disease of Being Busy.&#x201D;</a> Safi noticed that when he asked friends how they were doing, many of them responded by describing how busy they were&#x2014;not with an assessment of their internal state but rather with a mindless repetition of their endless external to-do list. While we may balk at the idea of busyness as a disease, arguing instead of its virtue, Safi reminds us that in never allowing ourselves to rest, we create a sense of dis-ease. For most of us, we don&#x2019;t allow our minds, our bodies or our souls to be at ease because we are always on the go.We can all relate to this overwhelming sense of feeling consistently harried. American adults and children alike are overscheduled and under-rested.&#xA0;<strong>Why is it so hard to slow down?<br></strong><a href=\"http://brenebrown.com/\">Bren&#xE9; Brown</a> calls this way of living &#x201C;crazy-busy&#x201D; and argues that it is a way to numb vulnerability. In her book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Gifts-Imperfection-Think-Supposed-Embrace/dp/159285849X\"><em>The Gifts of Imperfection</em></a>, Brown writes, &#x201C;We convince ourselves that if we stay busy enough and keep moving, reality won&#x2019;t be able to keep up.&#x201D; In other words, if we can keep ourselves occupied all of the time, we won&#x2019;t have to face the truth about our lives&#x2014;the pain, or the fear, or the shame that we feel deep down. And in trying to avoid difficult emotional realities, we exhaust ourselves&#xA0;and numb our ability to feel joy and connection.&#xA0;Safi points to several other reasons we may operate at this hectic pace. Maybe your job is so demanding that you don&#x2019;t feel permission to take time to rest. Maybe you have to stay busy because you&#x2019;re busting your butt to provide for your family. A point he reminds us of as &#x201C;twenty percent of our children are living in poverty, and too many of our parents are working minimum wage jobs just to put a roof over their head and something resembling food on the table.&#x201D;As for our kids? They feel the pressure too. They are trying to keep up and stand out in a world that is incredibly competitive. It seems that from age ten on they are expected to build a r&#xE9;sum&#xE9; of activities and extracurriculars that will elevate them above their peers.And even when&#xA0;we have an opportunity to rest, in our tech-heavy world, it is easy to feel required to stay busy. Safi points out that the numerous technological advances invented to make our lives simpler and our to-do lists shorter have actually just allowed us to cram more into our day. Instead of providing opportunity for rest, it seems technology has made us busier than ever because now, work can follow us home. He says, &#x201C;For some of us, the &#x2018;privileged&#x2019; ones, the lines between work and home have become blurred. We are on our devices. All. The. Freaking. Time.&#x201D; We quite literally do not know how to turn off, and our culture and our lifestyles often discourage us from doing so.&#xA0;<strong>We are human <em>beings</em>&#x2014;not human doings<br></strong>In the midst of our busyness dis-ease, it&#x2019;s time to ask what Safi so plainly questions&#x2014;&#x201C;When did we forget that we are human beings, not human doings?&#x201D; Despite the massive amount of value and emphasis we place on <em>doing</em>, we are ultimately made for <em>being.</em> Life is about balance, and if we never stop to be&#x2014;to get in touch with the calm center within ourselves&#x2014;we will forget how to find it. And the truth is, so many of us have.For our mental and emotional wellbeing and even for our creativity and productivity, we need to stop once in a while. It&#x2019;s important to strive to meet our goals and to work hard, but we also need to acknowledge the importance of taking time to rest, connecting with one another and allowing ourselves to sit in stillness.<strong>Be still<br></strong>As Brown reminds us&#x2014;&#x201C;Stillness is not about focusing on nothingness; it&#x2019;s about creating a clearing. It&#x2019;s opening up an emotionally clutter-free space and allowing ourselves to feel and think and dream and question.&#x201D; Collectively we lack stillness, though we crave it deeply.&#xA0;Safi says that when you want to ask someone how they are in Persian, you say &#x201C;<em>Haal-e shomaa chetoreh?&#x201D;, </em>which translates directly to &#x201C;How is your heart doing at this very moment, at this breath?&#x201D; So, how is your heart? Is it craving some stillness? Are you starting to feel like &#x201C;life&#x201D; is a four-letter word? If so, it&#x2019;s probably a pretty good sign you need to take some time to slow down now and again.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span><em>Photo: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/the_guvner/\" target=\"_blank\">Shawn Parr</a></em>"

       "content_body":"<em>Our guest writer today was inspired by a blog post we previously shared, suggesting that the older, more </em><a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/1771\" target=\"_blank\"><em>traditional collegiate system of education will soon give way </em></a><em>to online education. Here, Estelle shares her opposing point of view&#x2014;arguing that these new platforms still have much to learn from traditional classrooms, exploring the advantages and disadvantages of online education and what institutions, both online and offline, can do to more adequately integrate the efficiency of the Internet and the quality of brick-and-mortar classes.</em>The quality of online schooling is still considered to be below that of traditional classrooms. Yet, more students are packing into virtual schools than ever before. The growth rate of online education has, in fact, outpaced that of brick-and-mortar classrooms for years. It is time to evaluate whether the dubious quality of these online courses provide a valuable service, or whether they harm the quality of education in the United States.Affordability is one of the chief advantages of online learning. If a university does not need to take up the space of a physical classroom, then it is able to teach larger numbers of students. In theory, this would equate to lower costs for students and for the schools. On the other hand, however, the decrease in cost for physical space could be spent to raise the quality of the course in more concrete ways.That is the theory of <a href=\"http://www.k12.com/\" target=\"_blank\">K12 Inc</a>., the largest publicly traded business in online education. So far, the company has performed quite well, bringing in over $500 million in 2011. Stephanie Saul summarized this phenomenon in the <em>New York Times</em>, &#x201C;The growth of for-profit online schools&#x2026;is rooted in the theory that corporate efficiencies combined with the Internet can revolutionize public education, offering high quality at reduced cost.&#x201D; By using the Internet to distribute course materials, including lectures, an enterprise can reduce its costs considerably. That sounds promising, particularly now, with the cost of education so high.In practice, though, online schools suffer many of the same problems with funding as traditional schools. Attrition rates can be atrocious. Agora, one of K12&#x2019;s schools, was reported to have some extremely concerning issues with its student population. Roughly half of its students are behind in reading, more than half are behind in math, and one-third graduate late.Community colleges that use virtual classrooms have encountered problems of their own. An article published in April 2012, in <em>Inside Higher Ed </em>asked Fred Lokken, the council chair for the Instructional Technology Council, to explain a recent report his organization published about new trends in online learning. Lokken pointed out that fewer institutions offered online counseling and orientation in 2011 than in the previous year. These two services are typically viewed as integral to helping students stay on task, learn, and eventually graduate. In this way, community colleges are becoming more like K12 Inc. in their treatment of online students, exhibiting a lack of support and care for their students.If such large percentages of students fail to receive an adequate education in online programs, then it may not be the solution to problems in the United States&#x2019; education system. Some parents may opt to risk their son or daughter&#x2019;s schooling and enroll them in an online program, while others may be forced to do so because of economic concerns. In the end, more people have access to education, but this is a pyrrhic victory. If the quality or support systems in place are not up to the standard, these programs will lead to a national debate over how to regulate them.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"A few years ago I looked up the definition of the word gratitude. I look up words a lot, but that&#x2019;s a whole other conversation, so I&#x2019;ll stick to the story about what I learned in Funk &amp; Wagnalls. Like many people, I thought gratitude was a simple aspect of being thankful, some expression designed to communicate how pleased and/or perhaps relieved I was to have certain things, or feelings, or people in my life.I thought it sounded something like this:I&#x2019;m totally grateful for these amazing clients. OR;I have a lot of gratitude because my children are healthy.OR, if you&#x2019;re anything like me;Oh my goodness, the fact that this glass of wine is in my hand right now fills me with so much gratitude.But in my search for the meaning, literally and perhaps figuratively, I discovered that thankfulness is only half the story. I&#x2019;m not going to suggest that it isn&#x2019;t a beautiful half to know, but knowing the rest is key.When I cracked open my well-worn dictionary I saw a definition that included gratitude having to do with someone&#x2019;s willingness (and this is the important part) to return kindness, not just be grateful for it. In other words, being grateful means we&#x2019;re thankful to have something in our lives and are looking for ways to return it, pay it forward and give it back.My mind was blown. For years I&#x2019;d had gratitude all wrong. Well, maybe not all wrong, but 50% wrong is pretty wrong.After closing the dictionary and collecting the bits of my intellect that were swirling around like wispy, cirrocumulus clouds, I realized my entire attitude on gratitude had to change. If I was going to express appreciation in its fullest, truest, most beautiful form (because who wouldn&#x2019;t want to do that), I had to ask myself what I was grateful for receiving, and also what I was willing to give back and share with others. This thought changed my life in multiple ways.First and foremost, my understanding of the Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x2019; lyrics, Give it Away, deepened in a very profound way. Yes, I want to give it to my mamma! Yes, I want to give it to my papa! And other people too!Second, I did a complete one-eighty with the way I lived and worked. I switched my frame of mind from an I-want-I-need-thank-you-thank-you-thank-you attitude to a thank-you-thank-you-thank-you-now-how-can-I-help-you attitude. I started to give stuff away&#x2013;&#x2013;mostly time and energy, but other things too. I dished up my gratitude in generous heaps and held it out, offering myself to others in a brand new way.I&#x2019;m not suggesting that I gave everything away because you&#x2019;ve got to have energy and time and love in order to give. Nor am I suggesting that I stopped charging all my clients because I wasn&#x2019;t sure that would make for a very good business model. What I did was ask myself the following questions:What more can I give?and (my personal favorite);How much more of myself can I offer?The answers varied. Sometimes it was an extra five minutes, other times it was an entire afternoon. Sometimes it was a smile, other times it was a hope and a prayer. I thought in new ways about what offerings I was creating for my clients and if they included gratitude in the fullest sense. I thought about social media and if I was really taking time to comment on, and share, the stuff I love. I thought about the people I love and asked, &#x201C;How else can I support them?&#x201D;The result of my new appreciation for the Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x2019; song, as well as my brand new attitude of gratitude, was huge. Could I count it in dollars and cents? Probably, but an increase in my bank account isn&#x2019;t nearly as important to me as the increase I&#x2019;ve seen in the quality of my relationships, which by the way have skyrocketed.I typically close short articles like this by asking a question, but today in the spirit of gratitude I&#x2019;m going to change things up by sharing my favorite quote. I look at it every morning before I start writing. &#x201C;If you have a talent, use it in every which way possible. Don&#x2019;t hoard it. Don&#x2019;t dole it out like a miser. Spend it lavishly like a millionaire intent on going broke.&#x201D; &#x2013;Brendan FrancisIt&#x2019;s important to know that &#x201C;a talent&#x201D; can be something as simple as just being you. Use yourself in every way possible. Don&#x2019;t hoard yourself. Don&#x2019;t dole yourself out like a miser. Spend yourself lavishly, on others, like a millionaire intent on going broke.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

Although finances are, of course, very important to continue to run and scale a successful venture, I believe it is the heart that helps guide us in keeping the brand fresh, authentic, and continuing our mission to help feed as many people as we possibly can.<strong>What brands are doing a good job of influencing people to do better?</strong><br>GOOD is a wonderful social platform and magazine that is helping to influence and inspire people to do better. TOMS has had such a great impact in spreading the conscious consumerism movement. Krochet Kids is also a favorite of mine, employing women in Africa and Peru to hand-crochet hats and scarves, while giving each woman credit for her work.<strong>What would you say to other CEOs/social entrepreneurs to encourage them to pursue their passions?</strong><br>Everyone&#x2019;s journey is so different, so I find it hard to give specific advice. But I would say if you have a unique vision for something that would make the world a better place, you really have nothing to lose to make a go of it. The worst that can happen is that you learn a lot and perhaps have to evolve your idea to something else that might even be better than your initial idea. Believe in yourself and your vision, but also resign yourself to the journey.<strong>If your brand were a person from history, who would it be?</strong><br>FEED is a cross between Mother Theresa, Richard Branson, and Rosie the Riveter.<strong>How is your brand a reflection of you and your values?&#xA0;</strong><br>FEED is a reflection of me in many ways&#x2014;of my design aesthetic, my idea of how to do business and do good for the world, but more importantly FEED is a reflection of my values in that I believe we should all be doing what we can to address one of the greatest issues our world faces: hunger.<strong>If someone wrote a biography about you, what do you think the title should be?</strong><br>As of now, maybe &#x201C;FEED Soul: The Journey of an Idealistic Do-gooder, Social Entrepreneur, and Bag Peddler.&#x201D; But I have much more to do in my life, so this title will hopefully continue to grow and evolve.<strong>Pancakes or waffles?</strong><br>Buckwheat and blueberry pancakes. However this sparks an idea: why not combine pancakes and waffles, as they have done with croissants and donuts in to the famous &#x2018;cronut&#x2019;, and call it the &#x201C;panaffles&#x201D; or &#x201C;wacakes&#x201D;?!<strong>What mantra do you run your business by?</strong><br>I have a few. Love what you do, live what you love; surround yourself with good, hardworking people you respect; and strive to make a difference along the way.<strong>Tell us about the culture at FEED.</strong><br>The culture at FEED is really wonderful. I have the most amazing team of hardworking, dedicated FEEDers. FEED is a very rigorous place to work, but also very human and understanding. I don&#x2019;t mind if folks work from home occasionally or take extra time off to be with family and friends. As long as they are getting the job done, I want everyone to feel they lead happy lives, in and out of work.<strong>What&#x2019;s your personal favorite FEED product?</strong><br>This is very hard to say, as they are all my children. But I would probably have to pick the FEED 1 bag, since it is the first bag I designed that started FEED. I think if that bag were not so special, FEED would not be what it is today.<strong>You inspire a lot of people. Who inspires you?</strong><br>So many people inspire me. One person who inspired me very early in my career (at the time FEED was just an idea) was Mohammed Yunus. He took the simple and brilliant idea of giving loans to the poorest of the poor, and turned it into one of the most effective poverty fighting tools of our time&#x2014;micro-credit. I love when simple ideas like that can scale and have a real and lasting impact on people&#x2019;s lives.<strong>Favorite word?</strong><br>Goodness.<strong>Favorite place in the world (for a FEED product):</strong><br>Africa.<strong>Do you think we&#x2019;re in charge of our own happiness?</strong><br>Yes, every day we wake up and choose our happiness. The worst feeling in the world is to feel disempowered. We co-create our reality through who we choose to spend time with and how we choose to spend our time and resources. The more conscious we are of this simple truth, the happier we can be.&#xA0;Read more about our work with <a href=\"http://bdrummond.metajivedevelopment.com/our-work/feed-projects\" target=\"_blank\">FEED</a>.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span><a href=\"https://bulldogdrummond.s3.amazonaws.com/img/blog-image-full/1435609056040f2f20c41d898f720ca93924de1075.jpg\" class=\"fancybox\" title><img src=\"https://bulldogdrummond.s3.amazonaws.com/img/blog-image-full/1435609056040f2f20c41d898f720ca93924de1075.jpg\"></a>"

       "content_body":"In corporate America, there&#x2019;s a lot of talk about benefits and incentives, and rightly so. What companies offer in that space often informs their employment and makes employees more likely to work harder, stay longer, and be more productive. However, most benefits are, by their very nature, standardized by organization or by team&#x2014;so it&#x2019;s incumbent upon managers to identify levels of motivation and inspiration to engage their teams on an ongoing basis.One of my favorite examples of thinking differently in this space comes from my colleague, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dantyre\">Dan Tyre</a>. Dan doesn&#x2019;t inspire people by promising lavish trips, grand promotions, or wads of cash: he does it with breakfast sandwiches. Yep, good old-fashioned breakfast sandwiches.Before I explain, let me tell you a little bit about Dan. When Dan was a freshman in college, he noticed that there was only one bass player on campus and that the person was a senior. With the lone musician on campus graduating, surely there would be a shortage of bass players, so he applied basic economic theory, learned to play bass entirely on his own, and created massive demand for his musical talent throughout his college tenure and beyond. Dan is a person who thinks differently, always has, and brings a unique perspective to his life as a sales leader at <a href=\"http://www.hubspot.com\" target=\"_blank\">HubSpot</a>. So it&#x2019;s no surprise he has unconventional ideas for inspiring and motivating his team.So why do people work harder for a $3 breakfast sandwich? Spoiler alert: it has nothing to do with the cost. Any of the reps Dan works with could afford to purchase a breakfast sandwich on his or her own, but there&#x2019;s something about getting a warm customized breakfast order delivered right to your desk that makes everyone dig a little bit deeper and work just a tiny bit harder.<strong>What can we all learn from Dan&#x2019;s Egg McMuffin Theory of Motivation?</strong><strong>1)&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong><strong>Deliver the Unexpected: </strong>Regardless of what people do on a daily basis, they fall into their usual routines and start going through the motions. That can be good in the sense that they gain comfort in their environments, but it can also lead employees to be complacent instead of pushing themselves. Offering the unexpected can yield unexpected results, and that&#x2019;s good for your team and your organization. Whether that&#x2019;s mixing up the structure of your weekly meeting, shifting seats every few weeks to encourage people to meet other team members, or offering unconventional incentives, shaking things up is a catalyst for people to fight complacency.<strong>2)&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong><strong>Know Your Audience: </strong>I&#x2019;m constantly amazed by people who have a one size fits all approach to coaching. Invest the time to understand what inspires the people you work with and tailor your approach accordingly. For example, many college football programs reward exceptional play or effort with stickers on a helmet. Players don&#x2019;t compete for a sticker per se, but rather for the prestige and recognition associated with that sticker. Applying the same principle to another team in another sport at another school might not work&#x2014;leaders need incentives that fit the way their team members work.<strong>3)&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong><strong>The Sooner, the Better: </strong>As humans, we&#x2019;re wired to want immediacy, which is why traditional review systems are so broken. Think about it&#x2014;where else outside of work do you wait six months to tell someone what you think of them? The best feedback is instant, clear, concise, and actionable, and the same is true of rewards. If you see something, say something&#x2014;recognizing positive, or negative, behaviors as they happen is as important (<em>if not more so</em>) as identifying suggestions for improvement.Chances are, you don&#x2019;t remember the standard schwag your company gave out at your holiday party last year or the $10 gift card your manager gave you and your team five years ago for a job well done. There&#x2019;s a reason for that: most incentives are boring and do little to inspire a reaction. So the next time you&#x2019;re thinking about how to move the needle with your employees, take a page from Dan&#x2019;s book: think outside the box and be inspired by the breakfast sandwich. A little thoughtful motivation goes a long way, and your employees won&#x2019;t soon forget it.&#xA0;<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"<strong>Creativity vs Pragmatism, Imagine If They Could Meet In The Middle</strong>Every great brand begins as an idea&#x2013;&#x2013;something born out of love, genius, or even frustration, but always deeply rooted in passion. However, as the idea evolves into an actual product or service, and sales increase, creativity tends to take a back seat, while pragmatism prevails&#x2026; this is where the great marketing divide begins.For those who have a seat at the marketing decision-making table, it&#x2019;s likely you find it somewhat split between two mindsets: those who base decisions off of their gut and creative reservoir, and pragmatists who rely on hard data like ROI and impressions. While both mindsets are equally important, creatives often find themselves held hostage by data and, subsequently, their risk-taking is discouraged. This imbalance eventually leads to a lack of marketing innovation. A company who was once considered an industry thought-leader becomes seen as a follower, regardless of their product caliber.<strong>Data Ingenuity<br></strong>So how do you break away from the crowd while leveraging fiscally responsible data? A simple solution is to examine the market research. Quantitative data clearly serves a purpose by defining who your target customer is, but it often falls short by offering only the basics. For instance, the target customer is 42-year-old Suzy who is a stay-at-home mom with two children living in the suburbs with an average household income of $70,000. Obviously a strong portion of marketing resources should be focused on her. However, like most, Suzy is savvy when it comes to marketing ploys, and she expects an attempt to reach her through the obvious channels like <a href=\"http://www.parents.com/parents-magazine/\">Parents Magazine</a> and mommy blogs. So when she sees you reaching out to her via these anticipated mediums, she will already have her guard up.Research is a collaboration between the two mindsets, and can yield great results. Go beyond the traditional survey questions and take a deeper dive into getting to know each and every Suzy out there. <em>Why?</em> Because she thinks of herself as an individual with unique preferences, hobbies, and most importantly circle of influencers. Challenge yourself to conduct market research that delivers more qualitative data, particularly around those influencers. And by influencers, I don&#x2019;t mean bloggers and media. I&#x2019;m talking about Suzy&#x2019;s inner circle of trust&#x2013;&#x2013;which could be her yoga instructor, children&#x2019;s teachers, barista, running club, volunteer organization, favorite author, etc. Once you discover the prevailing parallels for every Suzy in your research, you&#x2019;ll find that you have far more fodder for creativity.<strong>A Bonding Experience<br></strong>With all of the newfound data, you can now look for new ways to meaningfully bond with your target customer, as well as expose new audiences to your brand with no additional risk. A basic example is a recent campaign my organization conducted for Petco. Their market research found that over half of pet parents were excited to go hiking with their dog this summer. With that knowledge, we sought out a non-traditional marketing partnership. Rather than team up with a veterinarian, we partnered with National Geographic&#x2019;s &#x201C;Adventurer of the Year&#x201D;, <a href=\"http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/best-of-adventure-2008/achievements/andrew-skurka.html\">Andrew Skurka</a>, for a multi-channel marketing activation championing outdoor pet safety. Not only were we reaching Petco&#x2019;s customers through a different voice while staying true to their brand identity, we were also tapping into Skurka&#x2019;s strong outdoor enthusiasts following&#x2013;&#x2013;many of them who are pet parents&#x2013;&#x2013;without the need to execute a separate campaign.A beautiful example of experiential marketing that goes beyond the expected channels to reach a target market is New Belgium Brewing Company&#x2019;s, &#x201C;<a href=\"http://www.newbelgium.com/events/tour-de-fat.aspx\">Tour de Fat</a>&#x201D;. This multi-city tour is a delicious carnival of sorts complete with a beer garden, chainsaw juggling, dance-off, live music and a bike parade&#x2013;&#x2013;all to raise funds for each community&#x2019;s Bike Coalition. Entry is free and all profit from beer sales goes to helping that city become more bike-friendly. The event has broad appeal, since beer enthusiasts run the gamut. However, this particular experience cleverly creates extreme brand loyalty with a cultural subset who are truly passionate about city biking. While I don&#x2019;t know if the Tour de Fat concept was based off of research findings, this is the type of genius marketing program that interrupts, but still feels authentic, and as a result it resonates.<strong>A United Front<br></strong>At the end of the day, marketing creatives and pragmatists can live in harmony by finding common ground. A campaign based off of hard data doesn&#x2019;t have to be predictable and boring. Use your marketing resources to understand your customer better, which will keep the numbers guys happy. Then use that information to reach people in places they are not expecting, through experiences that truly matter.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"<em><strong>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know where my work ends and I begin.&#x201D;</strong></em>I will never forget the moment when this was said to me at my final interview for a position as a nutrition and natural health strategist with a leading packaged food brand. The comment left me a bit stunned, honestly. It was certainly wasn&#x2019;t something I&#x2019;d heard before&#x2014;at least not in a positive context. I think we can all relate to roles that leave the idea of a work/life balance in a messy, disorganized heap. But when the woman&#x2014;now a good friend of mine&#x2014;described her blurred lines, she didn&#x2019;t mean it negatively; instead she was articulating a manifestation of personal philosophy into business. After joining the team I quickly realized she wasn&#x2019;t unique in this respect, and in fact many employees had experienced a similar blurring of the lines. The brand had become a manifestation of their collective philosophy of health and nutrition, and they were a manifestation of the brand&#x2019;s mission<strong>A New Value Proposition<br> </strong>For many industries today, there is an expectation that brands should be more than just a source for the latest trend or new product. More than ever, consumers are looking to brands as a tool for education and a way to demonstrate their own personal beliefs. Purchasing is not simply about products but voting&#x2014;a way to reflect and even help form their own personal values. And consumer data supports this insight: Brands that have a higher purpose for being in the world have higher consumer bonding and loyalty scores. &#xA0;<strong>Brand as Teacher<br> </strong>The organic and natural food space is one industry where preaching values has become commonplace, if not a requirement, for success. Whereas ten years ago, brand marketing was largely anchored in an articulation of the absence of negatives (e.g. &#x201C;no trans-fat&#x201D; or &#x201C;no high fructose corn syrup&#x201D;), the conversation today is about the presence of positives and connecting to a higher purpose. Brands not only tout the presence of whole grains, but the fact that the grains are also ethically and locally sourced. Real estate on cereal box panels provide infographics about biodynamic farming and soil cycles. For the brands that are winning in the market, cereal isn&#x2019;t just about cereal anymore&#x2014;it&#x2019;s about demonstrating thought leadership and inviting consumers to join a movement through their purchasing power.It was exactly this shift in the industry that drew me out of private practice and into CPG. Although I am a physician by training, my passion has always been in education. Though health education has traditionally taken place in a doctor&#x2019;s office, I was drawn away from private practice due to the evolving role of brands as educators and into an industry with the potential to educate on a massive scale.<strong>The Foundation of Brand Authenticity<br> </strong>Since leaving my private practice, I&#x2019;ve found the past eight years to be more rewarding that I ever could have imagined. As the strategists and storytellers behind product brands, we are in a fascinating moment in history. And although practicing what you preach will always be the foundation of brand authenticity, we now have a unique opportunity to preach what we practice and help lead conversations and ultimately people and planet health to a better place.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Entrepreneurs juggle a lot of balls, no doubt. The culmination of the many items that demand our attention on a day-to-day basis and the multitude of stressors that come along with the lifestyle we have chosen can make it seem impossible to focus our attention on any one thing for long.Not only does this make our lives take on a frenetic tempo but it can also have other, long-lasting negative impacts on our organizations and ourselves. Let&#x2019;s explore why trying to focus on multiple things at once doesn&#x2019;t really work all that well considering what we&#x2019;re trying to accomplish.<strong>How does our brain process information?</strong>Before we dive too deep into the whys and wherefores of attention, we have to take a moment to understand how our brains process information and guide our attention. The dual processing model of attention suggests that our attention is processed directly by the brain into both the Automatic System and the Controlled System.Think of the Automatic System like your cruise control. It is typically an environmentally driven stimulus-response type situation. These processes, like grabbing your first cup of coffee in the break room, don&#x2019;t require a ton of cognitive effort. Because simple tasks like this don&#x2019;t require a ton of focus to accomplish, as they are rote, they don&#x2019;t interfere with our ability to focus about other things at the same time.Our Controlled System, on the other hand, is comprised of mental processes that require a significant amount of cognitive effort. Think of these types of activities as those that you might turn the radio down for in order to accomplish them. They typically require us to dig into our memory in order to pull information to assist us with the current task, or activity, at hand and it is during these situations that our brains require a greater level of attention.<strong>Focus has its benefits.</strong>Imagine this&#x2026; walking into a meeting with a valued client or coworker and being able to absolutely and completely be fully present in the interaction without distraction. Image the impact that might have on you. Your feeling of control. Your ability to make higher quality decisions. Your ability to reduce your internal stress. Maybe even your ability to be happy with the way you are showing up in the world.<em>Read more from <a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/author/gothamculture#filters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">gothamCulture</a>.</em><em>Original <a href=\"https://gothamculture.com/2018/01/25/power-one-focus-fragmented-world/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a>.</em><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

Digging in and revisiting these early experiences and understanding how they affect and define one&#x2019;s current emotional state, moods, motivations and reactions to people and situations will enable one to make a transition from unconsciously existing in life, and constantly being frustrated and misunderstood to living a vibrant, conscious life with a deep and clear understanding of oneself as well as being able to understand the needs and motivations of others.Take an hour out of your week, grab a good glass of wine or a cup of coffee, find a comfortable quiet place and dig into the following questions to unlock a deeper understanding of you and what makes you tick.<strong>Pragmatism<br></strong>How did your parents positively and/or negatively affect who you are?<br>How do you see yourself today as a result of these experiences?

The glass was manufactured in Mexico and they were looking for an innovative way to recycle the waste. We had an idea to utilize an artisan group to recycle the waste in unique ways to create a product that we could bring to market&#x2014;and Studio Xaquixe was born.&#xA0;<strong>Who supports the project and why?<br></strong>Apolis, Chivas and the artisan group all passionately support the project.

Beyond that, the level of commerce is done independently through you and me supporting the <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pre-order-apolis-glassware-collection#/\" target=\"_blank\">Indiegogo campaign</a>.I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;re familiar with the proverb:<em>&#x201C;Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.&#x201D;</em>We found a lot of great fisherman but they don&#x2019;t have the right bait. We&#x2019;re hoping to change that.We&#x2019;re brining back a lost art. In the last ten years, 75% of all glass blowing studios in Mexico have closed due to increased operation costs and competition from global brands who can benefit from economies of scale. This social initiative is looking to take steps to put a stop to this decline and help artisan communities such as Studio Xaquixe to grow their business. We&#x2019;re also teaching them (<em>and ourselves, really</em>) to think long-term&#x2014;if we come to an artisan group with a single order then it could be counterproductive&#x2014;so we&#x2019;re looking at long-term demand and identifying the biggest needs.&#xA0;By working with retailers across the globe to stabilize a long-term order pipeline, and global consumer exposure that would otherwise be impossible for an organization of this size, we&#x2019;re creating a business strategy that ensures growth.The community has been very supportive and views the initiative as a platform for other industries to learn from.<strong>What does the project aspire to do?<br></strong>We&#x2019;re teaching artisans how to fish, so to speak&#x2014;providing them with the right bait and tools, and teaching them how to use them. The project will create the world&#x2019;s first artisan designer collaborative marketplace with the goal of giving artisans a better understanding of what&#x2019;s relevant to a larger market and to create an accelerated way to bring products to market. Design is paramount in the process. There&#x2019;s no need for more stuff, so products must be utilizable and needed day to day.We&#x2019;re hoping to inspire bigger thinking. Big and small need to work together to make change. Large corporations and the small artisan world can benefit by working together. Bringing awareness that creative capitalism is a powerful tool that&#x2019;s much more than a marketing story. Through this business model we want to connect individuals from all walks of life who believe we desperately need to rethink the way we buy and sell.<strong>Watch more about the project here</strong>:<strong>How you can help:</strong>From October 6<sup>th</sup> through November 14th 2015 we are introducing the first artisan + designer collaboration marketplace in partnership with Indiegogo. <strong>We need YOUR help to support one of the few remaining glass blowing studios in Mexico by partnering with us and pre-ordering our new collection of <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pre-order-apolis-glassware-collection#/\" target=\"_blank\">Apolis glassware</a>.&#xA0;</strong><strong>Support the <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pre-order-apolis-glassware-collection#/\" target=\"_blank\">Indiegogo Campaign</a>.</strong>For more information about the <a href=\"http://www.apolisglobal.com/exchange/\" target=\"_blank\">Apolis Global Citizen Exchange</a> visit their website.

       "content_body":"For far too long, we&#x2019;ve been operating under management philosophies that undervalue being human. The Industrial Revolution did a lot of good things for the world, but the organizations designed to support manufacturing businesses common in that era are not one of them. They are hierarchical and rigid and have little allowance for human variation. Even in their friendliest form, they are paternalistic, placing the burden of responsibility on a select few in positions of authority.Mechanistic terms and phrases used to describe people and how they work together like: creative engine, mental horsepower, well-oiled machine, weakest link, and human capital are woven through our everyday language. I&#x2019;m all for the creative use of metaphor, but I think in linguistic terms, the ubiquity of these terms points to an underlying framework that is decidedly not human. At the heart of the industrial view of the world is a reductionist philosophy that leads people to break everything down to the component parts and attempt to optimize the fit and performance of each item in isolation. The problem is humans are not that simple. We can understand how molecules stick together and how synapses fire, but they don&#x2019;t actually work in isolation of each other. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. People have soul, and heart, and passion.The effect of not having a human-centered framework for workplace design is decidedly negative. According to the<a href=\"http://businessjournal.gallup.com/content/24880/Gallup-Study-Engaged-Employees-Inspire-Company.aspx\" target=\"_blank\"> Gallup Management Journal</a>, only 29% of U.S. workers are engaged, while 56% are not engaged, and 15% are actively disengaged. That is, when people are treated (even subconsciously) as machines, they don&#x2019;t perform at their best. They might do what they are told until they no longer have to, but they are not inspired to create, build, or serve in ways that leverage their full potential and deliver great value.<strong>Join the Human Revolution</strong>Most organizations we know today are built to be stable and predictable, using rigid specifications honed by financial metrics. But there is increasing evidence that this type of organization doesn&#x2019;t do well in environments that are transforming, ambiguous, or complex (Think: Dinosaurs). See more on this comparison in <a href=\"http://communicationnation.blogspot.com/2011/02/connected-company.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Connected Company</a> by Dave Gray. So this is a call for organizations of all types, whether they are businesses, governmental agencies, community groups, schools, or sports teams, to rethink their fundamental principles of organization and shift from industrial age thinking to a human-centered design that helps people thrive.This shift is intimidating. It&#x2019;s about losing control and building trust. It&#x2019;s about helping people grow versus boxing them in with rules and boundaries. It requires a belief in the innate greatness of human kind versus a bureaucratic defense against slackers and cheats.But the rewards are substantial. Organizations of all types struggle with low creative output, poor service, and declining productivity. Optimization and consolidation can only squeeze performance on the margin so much. For sustainable high performance in service, innovation, invention, or productivity, people must be at their best. And to be at their best, they must <em>be well.</em>Even in stable environments, where companies make big investments in predictable consumer patterns (like retail or automotive), people perform better when they are treated like <em>people</em>, not cogs in the machine. <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/wellbeing.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">The Gallup/Healthways Well-Being study</a> demonstrates a very clear economic advantage of employee well-being when you understand the impact of absenteeism, illness, and low engagement on a company&#x2019;s bottom line.<strong>Before Engagement</strong>Progressive organizations are already committed to the idea that employee engagement drives high performance. But many of these companies still approach engagement with command and control tactics. In response to a slippery company culture concern, I recently heard a very successful business leader say, &#x201C;Give me 120 minutes with our managers and I&#x2019;ll tell them how this is supposed to work.&#x201D; Sorry, but you can&#x2019;t order people to be good leaders. Or be creative. Or give good service. Or invent a new technology. They have to want to do it themselves and make very difficult emotional, social, and intellectual trade-offs to get there. See a comprehensive view on this point by Daniel Pink <a href=\"http://www.danpink.com/drive\" target=\"_blank\">in his book <em>Drive</em></a>.So while engagement is a great leading indicator for high performance, it&#x2019;s a lagging indicator of wellness. That is the capacity to give discretionary effort and highly valuable contributions depends on individual wellness. If you are not well, it&#x2019;s very difficult to be fully engaged.Viewing wellness as a foundation for high performance makes it more clear what things an organization should have in place to help people perform at extraordinary levels. This is where things start to get messy, because in the traditional relationship of employee and employer many of the requirements for wellness are considered private or &#x201C;none of your business.&#x201D; But if learned one thing in graduate school, it came from professor Charles F. Luna: <em>Things that matter are messy.</em><strong><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/sanchom/2963072255/in/photostream/\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1814\" title=\"1A_exercise_signs_web\" src=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/1A_exercise_signs_web.jpg\" alt width=\"395\" height=\"232\"></a></strong><strong>Being Fully Human</strong>Many people associate the term wellness with physical health. It&#x2019;s not hard to understand that proper nutrition, rest, and exercise lead to higher levels of energy. So let&#x2019;s just start there: What is your organization doing to help your people in these areas? Do you have recess? Do you make people take time off? Do you provide healthy food options as snacks?But don&#x2019;t forget that physical health is only one piece of the wellness puzzle. Well-being is about being <em>fully human</em>, which also includes dimensions of mental, social, spiritual, and emotional health. Philosophers have worked on the definition of &#x201C;being human&#x201D; since the beginning of recorded history, and probably before then. Aristotle, Maslow, and more recently a slew of companies like Daily Feats, Me You Health, and Kairos Labs have outlined broad models for well-being.The desire for wellness is not a new phenomenon for us humans. Conventional wisdom is dripping with advice for how to live a good life. Phrases like <em>an apple a day keeps the doctor away; peace (complete with two finger gesture); never go to bed angry; early to bed early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise</em>; etc. are &#x201C;rules of thumb&#x201D; developed over generations to show the way to balance, fulfillment, and happiness. Research on happiness has boomed recently. I&#x2019;ve even seen it stated that <a href=\"http://schedule.sxsw.com/2012/events/event_IAP100013\" target=\"_blank\">happiness is the new currency.</a>So wellness is not new, but it&#x2019;s very elusive. For many of us it&#x2019;s very hard to pay attention to all aspects of wellness simultaneously and adjust our habits to get there. Worse, much of the conventional wisdom or common sense tactics for living well are not tested, and some are quite simply wrong. See more on positive habit formation by Timothy Wilson in his book <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Redirect-Surprising-Science-Psychological-ebook/dp/product-description/B004QX078W\" target=\"_blank\">Redirect</a>.</em><strong>Work is Life</strong>I think the biggest failure by organizations in this regard is the separation of &#x201C;work&#x201D; and &#x201C;life&#x201D;. Work, as we&#x2019;ve defined it for centuries, is a burden to bear, not a form of pleasure. And Life is something you do when you are not working. So we &#x201C;work for the weekends&#x201D; and then &#x201C;live it up&#x201D; only to &#x201C;get back to the grind&#x201D; on Mondays. Shoot me now.Certainly many people along the way have enjoyed their careers and found joy in their efforts. But the dominant mindset of corporations and institutions is to root out all &#x201C;softer&#x201D; elements of working under the banners of focus, optimization, and efficiency. Office cubes, assembly lines, warehouses, and even schools and hospitals have been designed to remove critical human needs like friendship, beauty, and laughter, so workers can focus and get shit done. Most corporate policies, procedures, practices, and routines are built on the same blueprint of efficiency and optimization. But all work and no play, makes Jack a very dull boy (Check out this great scene from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOBbJw0MLvk\" target=\"_blank\">The Shining</a>).There is hope in world of work. Companies like 3M, IDEO, and Google are famous for their humanistic values and have great results to show for it. Zoom out and this transformation seems overwhelming. So you&#x2019;ll probably just stay the course and ride this out until retirement sets you free.Zoom in and focus on just one thing you can do tomorrow to start working like a human. Take a walk in the middle of the day. Eat grapes instead of a bag of chips. Personalize your desk with a plant or drawing from your favorite 5 year old. Every little thing counts, but you can&#x2019;t count unless you do something.<strong>Get moving.</strong><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"On our quest to build a plane, we&#x2019;re quickly realizing it&#x2019;s the wings that allow us to fly. In our startup journey the wings represent the idea. We know that the more aerodynamic the wings, the faster and higher the plane will climb. Similarly, the better designed the idea is, the higher and faster the business will climb.&#x201C;<em>You&#x2019;re only given a little spark of madness. You mustn&#x2019;t lose it</em>.&#x201D; &#x2013; Robin WilliamsThis quote from the late Robin Williams resonated with us given the journey that we&#x2019;ve been on the past few years. Like most entrepreneurs, we&#x2019;ve shed a lot of blood sweat and tears and admittedly wanted to give up on more than one occasion. We&#x2019;ve had many moments where we&#x2019;ve found ourselves looking at each other and saying &#x201C;Are we f%^&amp;* crazy?&#x201D; The truth is that we probably are. But it&#x2019;s unlikely that we&#x2019;d be where we are today without being a little bit nuts. Our madness&#xA0;sparked an idea, and gave us the drive and perseverance to build a strategy to support it. We can&#x2019;t pinpoint exactly what the craziness is attributed to, but we can look at our similarities as partners and best friends and draw a few hypotheses&#x2026;Coincidentally, we are both first born and we share many of the common first-born traits. We have extreme confidence in our abilities and in our ideas. With that confidence we have been able to recruit a team of believers. Second, we are extremely determined. Because our parents depended on us at an early age, we&#x2019;re obsessive about finishing projects that we start. Third, we were born leaders. Whether on the soccer field or volleyball court, in the classroom or in the boardroom, we have always led the charge. Fourth, there is a method to our madness. We know where to find resources, whom to ask and in what order tasks should be done. We&#x2019;re all about working smart and allocating our resources efficiently. And lastly, we are perfectionists. Our parents always had high expectations of us, so in turn we have high expectations of others. We believe that there is always room for improvement and that complacency or &#x201C;it&#x2019;s good enough&#x201D; is not an option.With traits like these, we think of at least a dozen ideas a week that excite us. Every problem we encounter, every need that we have, and every brand that we admire inspire us. A few processes in particular have turned our spark of madness into the framework of our wings. (Our apologies for being a bit vague here, we promise that we&#x2019;re very close to unveiling, we&#x2019;re just not quite ready yet&#x2026;)<strong>Make the problem personal. &#xA0;</strong>A $12 billion dollar industry dominated by a few big players. A saturated market where the threat of entry is high. A recognized niche opportunity that requires a unique solution. Today, nobody serves this niche as a standalone brand&#x2014;and that became personal to us.<strong>Listen to your intuition.&#xA0;</strong>Knowing for years that we were going to start our own brand, the questions were how and when? How do we differentiate our brand from the 100&#x2019;s of other product lines? In a space dominated by a half dozen large players, a focused strategy solving a specific problem is key. Our own &#x201C;a-ha&#x201D; moment was at lunch last fall while experiencing a difficult time with a client. There were so many areas of the business we had influence over, but also so many decisions that we would have made differently given the opportunity to do them over again. Our conclusion&#x2014;we needed to use our own professional experiences and personal stories to create a brand for women like us.<strong>Think big and stay focused.</strong>Before we took the leap, we spent months flushing out our idea, conducting countless hours of research attempting to predict the future viability of the marketplace. Our first step was to focus on the foundation. With <a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com\" target=\"_blank\">Bulldog Drummond</a>&#x2019;s help we are building the brand, the voice and a solid product lineup.Avoiding getting caught in a web of details is a daily struggle&#x2026; just last week we spent four hours deciding which pantone color is the right shade for our products followed by a three hour debate about our angel investment. When we get caught in the weeds we cut the crap, clear our heads, hang with our loved ones and reconvene the next day.<strong>Shut your mouth and open your ears.</strong>You don&#x2019;t learn much by being the smartest person in the room. Admitting you don&#x2019;t know a lot is difficult, but can be one of the best learning experiences to build your wings. We&#x2019;re fortunate to be surrounded by a network of incredibly smart people who care about our success and whom we trust implicitly. They have the knowledge and the skills to help keep us focused on our journey.Despite our innate traits, humility and gratitude are the two that we lean on and continue to develop as we grow. We are very lucky to have encountered so many inspirational people in our professional career. They have not only found success in business, but in life, love and family. They put others first and truly enjoy passing on their knowledge and support to those who have a great idea and the passion to support it. As entrepreneurs, we all share that same spark and it gives us the strength to stay focused as we build our plane&#x2026; call it madness, call it passion, call it wings.Here are our UNCOMMON SENSE observations for designing wings:1. <strong>Bold is admirable and humility is sexy.</strong> Humility is rooted in authenticity. Being true to yourself and your values ensures a foundation for success.2. <strong>Gratitude is the attitude</strong>. Be genuinely grateful. You get to choose your attitude each and every day. This principle is a great reminder that our challenges help define us positively as much as they do negatively. And while circumstances might trigger challenges, we choose the attitude with which we approach them.3. <strong>Focus on the solution not the problem.</strong> Hesitation is the product of fear. Replace the fear of the unknown with curiosity and when people say &#x201C;no&#x201D;, show them &#x201C;yes&#x201D;.4. <strong>You cannot inspire change without a little bit of madness</strong>. Overcome the notion that you must be regular. It robs you of the chance to be extraordinary.5. <strong>It&#x2019;s not about the idea, it&#x2019;s about making the idea happen</strong>. Perseverance is priceless. Go out. Do things. Create change. Otherwise stop bothering those of us who are.Stay tuned for the next chapter of our series.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"When someone asks us what it feels like to start a company, we use words like: scary, exciting, exhausting, invigorating, overwhelming and motivating. Frankly, it&#x2019;s all of those things and it&#x2019;s difficult to express without sounding like a masochist or a complete lunatic. A couple of weeks ago we came across <a href=\"http://startuplife.quora.com/How-a-Business-is-Like-an-Airplane\" target=\"_blank\">an article</a> by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/derrickfung\" target=\"_blank\">Derrick Fung</a>, CEO of <a href=\"http://www.tunezy.com\" target=\"_blank\">Tunezy</a> who nailed the feeling in one sentence. &#x201C;It feels like you&#x2019;re jumping off a cliff and building an airplane on the way down.&#x201D; So true.No matter how solid your business plan, how talented your team is, or what your financial picture look like, all entrepreneurs begin by jumping off of a cliff with a bag full of parts and tools. The goal&#x2014;build a brand new 747 while plummeting to the ground at 122 mph. Intense? You bet.Intensity is the name of the game sprinkled with a few blissful moments with our families, a nice glass of wine or a rare weekend away. Overall, this 7-part series is not to tell you how to start a business but give you insight into the good, the bad and the ugly of building an airplane while free falling. Ready to take the leap? Before you jump, take a step back from the edge and look to your right. Is your co-pilot standing there with you? If not, you have some work to do before you jump.You absolutely cannot survive this journey alone. Your co-pilot can be your business partner, your spouse, your accountant, or your mother. You can have more than one co-pilot, your co-pilot could live 3,000 miles away, or your co-pilot could change from one year to the next. You need a co-pilot to back you up at a moments notice, bring you a cup of coffee when you start to fall asleep after too many all-nighters, and be brutally honest with you. Most of all, you and your co-pilot need to be all in.<strong><em>About the Pilots</em></strong>Rather than bore you with our Meyers-Briggs profiles, we&#x2019;ll introduce ourselves in a more descriptive way: The Rebel and The Changeaholic.<a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Erika_Headshot-copy.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6082\" title=\"Erika_Headshot-copy\" src=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Erika_Headshot-copy.jpg\" alt width=\"395\" height=\"395\"></a>Hi my name is Erika, and I&#x2019;m a Rebel.Looking backwards, consistency has had no chance in my life. Since day one, I have had the yearning desire to buck the system and climb towards a bigger, brighter goal. This isn&#x2019;t a therapy session, so let&#x2019;s start in 2005 when I graduated from college&#x2026; in typical rebel fashion, no job, no apartment, I loaded up a 10&#xD7;10 Uhaul truck and drove north to San Francisco. Found an apartment and a couple of weeks later, landed a job in the Financial District as the assistant to the Chief Technology Officer at a prestigious asset management firm. I knew nothing about asset management and I knew even less about technology. I was terrified (<em>don&#x2019;t tell</em>), but I was also intensely motivated to work hard and climb the ladder. I realized very quickly that this climb was going to be much slower than expected. I also realized that I wasn&#x2019;t interested in IT. At all.Something that did spark my interest was breaking down professional and cultural barriers and helping others realize their potential&#x2014;where they came from, what makes them tick and what makes them shine&#x2026; It must have been obvious because I was quickly transferred to human resources. Don&#x2019;t get me wrong, the position was challenging and the potential was great, but again I realized I was suffocating and did not belong in the corporate world. Feeling a strong need for something without boundaries, something brighter and more influential I enrolled in Grad School. Fast-forward 3 years, and two masters degrees to a hot July evening in a shitty economy, considering (<em>more like dreading</em>) another respectable corporate job when I got a call from my old friend, the Changeaholic&#x2026;<a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/elisa_headshot_square-copy.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6083\" title=\"elisa_headshot_square-copy\" src=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/elisa_headshot_square-copy.jpg\" alt width=\"395\" height=\"395\"></a>Hi my name is Elisa, and I&#x2019;m a Changeaholic.I will concede that I have a few constants in my life: blonde hair, coffee, two inexhaustible kids, red wine (<em>see last item</em>), and two brilliant co pilots&#x2014;Erika and my husband.I met my husband, on spring break in Mexico when I was 20. He was at Annapolis, a naval officer in training and I was at UCSB, a lawyer in training. Fast forward 24 months, we married, started a family and began to build our careers. His traditional and mine, the exact opposite. Rather than pursue a steady career in law, our ever-changing military lifestyle led me to a career in consulting for multiple startups in my constants, fashion and beauty. &#xA0;It was great, but I soon realized that this journey was getting too turbulent to fly alone&#x2026; So I buzzed my old friend, the Rebel&#x2026;Fast forward 5 years, and a surfeit of consulting, we&#x2019;ve realized that our professional partnership is something special. First off, we haven&#x2019;t killed each other. It&#x2019;s actually quite the opposite. Our respect is deeper and more profound than ever which is why we&#x2019;ve taken this leap together to start our own brand. We&#x2019;ve realized our strengths, accepted our weaknesses and succeeded on all of our journeys despite our rebellious and changeling tendencies.It&#x2019;s time to take it to the next level&#x2026; With this foundation and the support of <a href=\"http://www.bulldogdrummond.com/#/panel-ventures\" target=\"_blank\">Bulldog Ventures</a>, we&#x2019;re taking the leap.

It&#x2019;s going to be a bit of a free fall, but we&#x2019;re going to build one hell of an airplane. Buckle your seatbelt, return your seats to the upright position, and prepare for a turbulent ride.Having a partner in business is just as essential as life, your co-pilot supports you when you can&#x2019;t support your self, motivates you when you&#x2019;re not, fuels you when you&#x2019;re out of gas, and compliments everything you do.Here are our Uncommon Sense Observations for Choosing A Sound Co-Pilot:Stay tuned for the next chapter of our series.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Getting a person to let their guard down is not easy. Just verbalizing the words raises a person&#x2019;s defenses. It&#x2019;s as if the suggestion alone raises obstacles. First, a person has to consider the source. If a spectator advises a boxer&#x2014;as he enters the ring&#x2014;to let his guard down, the outsider probably doesn&#x2019;t have the pugilist&#x2019;s best interests at heart. The timing of the advice betrays a concern over a wager, not the boxer&#x2019;s safety. Second, a person has to consider the setting. A young football player letting his guard down as he digs in to protect his quarterback is not good mental discipline; yet the same player must have the discipline&#x2014;if he doesn&#x2019;t want to repeat the same mistake on the next play&#x2014;to hear the coach&#x2019;s advice. No matter the timing, the player&#x2019;s guard must come down to hear the coach. A good coach sets the right environment so that a player, or an employee, will be most receptive to the message. To get a person to let down their guard, a consistent, predictable, and positive coaching action works best&#x2014;not words.<strong>Coaching in Business</strong>When a CEO calls an individual into his office for a discussion, critical dynamics are at play. The last thought that would cross most employees&#x2019; minds is to let their guard down as they walk into the corner office. In fact, in such a situation, it is both the &#x201C;who&#x201D; and the &#x201C;setting&#x201D; that raises barriers. Much to the chagrin of both, conflict may be the result when nothing more than good counsel was sought.As an employee enters a corner office they wonder, &#x201C;At this particular moment, is this my coach dispensing advice, or is this my leader dispensing a &#x2018;thus sayeth the lord?&#x2019;&#x201D; If the conversation starts to rumble, the employee wonders if the executive across the desk has just touched gloves, as it were, and wants a good contest&#x2014;no matter the outcome. Or has a winner been preordained?<strong>One Chief Executive Officer&#x2019;s Method</strong>Watson Sr., the traditional founder of IBM, communicated to an employee entering his office in a non-verbal way that they should either let their guard down or put their dukes up. Mrs. Ruth Leach Amonette, describes in <em>Among Equals</em> Watson Sr.&#x2019;s technique.Once, he summoned me upstairs to his office and asked me to sit in the chair at the right side of his desk. This would be a friendly conversation, I knew. Had he asked me to sit in the chair on the other side of his desk, the conversation might not have been so pleasant.She knew&#x2014;in an instant&#x2014;that her Chief Executive Officer was seeking advice. After he confirmed her thoughts, he summoned the editor and the entire <em>THINK Magazine</em> staff into his office&#x2014;who were obviously now standing on &#x201C;the other side&#x201D; of his desk. He told them what needed to be done in the next issue. The editor, not realizing the side of the desk he was on said, &#x201C;But we can&#x2019;t implement that idea now for the next issue. The presses are rolling at this very moment.&#x201D; To which Mr. Watson responded, &#x201C;Well then, stop the presses, NOW!&#x201D;So in November of 1943, <em>THINK Magazine</em> rolled out an issue more like <em>Readers Digest</em> with entirely self-contained articles that always continued on the next page until finished&#x2014;the reader would never again be asked to flip ten or twenty pages to read the conclusion of an article. The following month, <em>THINK Magazine</em> carried an article by the same Ruth Leach Amonette entitled &#x201C;Women in Industry&#x201D;. It displayed her new title of Vice President, International Business Machines Corporation. She had become IBM&#x2019;s first female senior executive. If any CEO ever wanted to send a clear message that providing good advice in the corner office would advance a career, Mr. Watson knew how to accomplish it.Setting the situation properly also ensures that diligent employees stand in their own defense. William Simmons in <em>Inside IBM: The Watson Years</em> writes a wonderful story about how he was (almost) fired by Mr. Watson but then promoted a few days later to Director of Product Planning. He found himself on the wrong side of the Chief Executive Officer&#x2019;s desk after a real estate agent claimed that he and another IBMer had lied about a real estate deal. Watson Sr. looked at the two employees standing before him and said, &#x201C;We have no room for such people in IBM&#x2014;they are fired. Gentlemen, I&#x2019;m sorry. I&#x2019;m afraid you have lied to this man.&#x201D;While the IBMer next to him appeared terrified, Bill Simmons stood his ground. As Bill explained the circumstances, he saw the storm front slowly dissipate from Watson&#x2019;s face. Then Watson said with a small smile, &#x201C;I believe you have been economical of the truth, but that is not lying.&#x201D; A few days later the Chief Executive Officer promoted Mr. Simmons to his new position at IBM.<strong>Let your guard down, put up your dukes or get to work</strong>Many employees become chameleons when threatened&#x2014;they blend into their surroundings. But the last thing any executive needs is a company of employee-chameleons disappearing into the woodwork every time he or she enters the room. The daily life of successful leaders involves many transformations and, of necessity, they must assume different personas. An executive who is truly extracting the best from everyone must feel like a shapeshifter. There are times when a decision has been made and it&#x2019;s time to move forward, there are times when advice and counsel are sought, and there are times when a sparring match is needed to reveal the weaknesses of an idea. If an executive hears discussion when he needs action, or notices a deathly silence when he requires advice, he should ensure the employees knows which side of the desk they are on. Employees need guidance to deliver consistent results&#x2014;and consistent, predictable, positive, non-verbal prompts can set the right environment.Trust relaxes a person&#x2019;s guard. Never violate that trust. Landing a sucker punch when someone has let down their guard is a betrayal. And word of such an act travels fast. As a result, two of the most important characteristics a leader needs to lead have been damaged: trust and respect.When a person lets down their guard, it is an act of trust.Trust is earned. It is not given on demand.Setting the right environment is important.Respecting that environment is critical.And great CEO&#x2019;s get it.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"When the Postins&#x2019; family dog, Mosi, came down with skin allergies, their immediate response was to try to solve the problem. Lucy Postins suspected that the allergies were linked to food so she began making meals for the dog in her kitchen using natural, human quality ingredients. Mosi&#x2019;s problems promptly cleared up but Lucy was left with a two-hour daily chore to prepare the meals. To save time, she began exploring dehydrated ingredients to make the meals.Meanwhile, friends down at the park noticed the positive difference. After dialing in the formula, Lucy and husband, Charlie, decided to start selling the food in plastic containers. They would be selling into a growing market. According to&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.petfoodindustry.com/blogs/7-adventures-in-pet-food/post/6263-global-pet-care-sales-pass-100-billion-for-first-time\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Euromonitor</a>, global sales of pet care products exceeded $100 billion in 2016, growing at a faster pace than other consumer goods categories.&#xA0;&#x201C;From the beginning, we were clear about our mission to help pets through better nutrition. We weren&#x2019;t sure that it would turn into the business that it&#x2019;s become,&#x201D;&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.thehonestkitchen.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Honest Kitchen</a>&#xA0;president Charlie Postins said. Early indications were positive though as they received their first online order before they were able to test their website. That was soon followed by an order from a local pet supply store. Their garage quickly was repurposed as a warehouse and shipping center. Lucy ran the business while Charlie continued in his day job as a designer at Nissan and prepared customer orders at night.From the start with a single dog food formula in 2002, The Honest Kitchen (THK) went on to produce new formulations for different dietary needs for dogs and cats. The company also received clearance from the FDA to claim &#x201C;human grade&#x201D; on their product labeling. By 2009, the company was producing more than 100,000 pounds of food. In 2011, the company brought in its first outside investment. With a staff of 50, the company now sells in more than 5,000 retail locations around the country.Along the way, The Honest Kitchen products have fostered a rabid following from pet owners who turned to them to address pet health issues. Satisfied owners have shared thousands of success stories which the company then dubbed&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.thehonestkitchen.com/truestories\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Honest Kitchen True</a><a href=\"https://www.thehonestkitchen.com/truestories\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">&#xA0;Stories</a>.Clearly, a good idea and a good product are fundamental to building a successful business. However, creating and scaling that company for long term growth presents a myriad of challenges. Navigating those issues often matters more than the original idea. The Postins&#x2019; built a $40+ million revenue company from their kitchen at home. Here are some of the principles they used to guide their progress.&#xA0;Scaling Tips from The Honest Kitchen:Most of all, The Honest Kitchen&apos;s success is about establishing a clear mission and staying true to it&#x2026;sometimes stubbornly. Many companies get sidetracked by pursuing too many things at once. That scattered approach weakens execution and also drains resources. &#x201C;My advice would be to commit to the mission and strategy,&#x201D; said Postins, &#x201C;and stay the course.&#x201D;&#xA0;&#xA0;Original post: <a href=\"http://www.bottlerocketadvisors.com/bottle-rocket-blog/2017/10/23/40-million-from-the-kitchen-7-lessons-in-scaling-up-from-the-honest-kitchen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BottleRocketAdvisors</a>More from this <a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/author/michael-irwin#filters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">author</a>.&#xA0;<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span><em>Photo: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/honestkitchen\" target=\"_blank\">The Honest Kitchen</a></em>"

       "content_body":"Edith Wharton once said, &#x201C;Ah, good conversation&#x2014;there&#x2019;s nothing like it, is there? The air of ideas is the only air worth breathing.&#x201D;Ms. Wharton had a way with words (written and otherwise), but she would likely be horrified to know that most of our daily conversations nowadays start with shorthand texts or three-line emails. And yet, in spite of the proliferation of texting and emailing in modern conversations, you still have to know how to strike up a conversation to get a raise, build your network, ask someone out, or provide someone with feedback.It&#x2019;s as important now as it ever was to know how to break the ice, get to the point, make a connection, and frame a request.&#xA0;But it&#x2019;s hard. That&#x2019;s why we put together this handy guide on talking to anyone about anything. We hope these tips help you navigate everything from cocktail parties to conference rooms with the greatest of ease.<strong>Ask better questions to get better answers.</strong><br>If you ask yes or no questions, you&#x2019;ll get yes or no answers. Most of us are conditioned to ask and respond to the same questions at every cocktail party we attend&#x2014;so do everyone a favor and leave the &#x201C;what do you do for work&#x201D; as a first question at home.<br><br>Asking more interesting questions gets you undeniably better answers. So instead of probing on what someone does now (which typically leads to awkward humble bragging), ask what they wanted to be when they grew up, what their first concert was, what magazines they subscribe to, or which celebrity they&#x2019;d want to invite over for dinner. Doing so relieves people of the boring back-and-forth of typical office party conversation and into far more interesting territory.<br><br>The same rule applies to business settings. I&#x2019;ve never once hired someone who didn&#x2019;t have solid questions for me about the market we compete in, the team he or she would be working on, and the company work environment. Whether you&#x2019;re networking for your next career move, interviewing for a job, or meeting with a potential new vendor or partner, your goal should be to ask questions that can&#x2019;t be answered with a quick Google search.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve included some examples below:<br><strong>On Competition</strong><br><strong>Good:</strong> Who does your company compete with?<br><strong>Better:</strong> I noticed that one of your competitors recently released X feature. How do you think that will change your competitive strategy moving forward?<br><strong>Best:</strong> Many people view your competition as Y and Z, but I really think long-term that Company A could be a threat, given that you&#x2019;re both converging toward the ecommerce space. How do you think about your long-term competitive strategy as it relates to Company A?<br><br><strong>On a Specific Role</strong><br><strong>Good:</strong> What does this role entail?<br><strong>Better:</strong> I know this role entails a significant amount of customer interaction. Can you tell me a little bit about how much of the expectation is around customer service versus upsells?<br><strong>Best:</strong> I read on <a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com\" target=\"_blank\">Glassdoor </a>that people in this role are expected to deliver roughly 30% of all upsells. What is the training process like to deliver this, and how does your comp structure reward over-performance on that goal, if at all?<br><br><strong>On Work Environment</strong><br><strong>Good:</strong> What&#x2019;s it like to work here?<br><strong>Better:</strong> Your company has recently doubled in size, and I&#x2019;ve read a lot about your commitment to flexibility and autonomy. Has that changed at all over the last year?<br><strong>Best:</strong> Recently, one of your tech leads wrote a blog about how engineers ship code during their first week on the job here. How does that same principle of autonomy apply on teams outside engineering?<br>Just as you wouldn&#x2019;t show up at someone&#x2019;s home for a party empty-handed, don&#x2019;t show up to a networking event, meeting, social event, or dinner without some thoughtful questions for your counterparts. <strong>The best conversations start with better questions, so do your homework.</strong> Anyone can do a quick Google search; go a level deeper to inspire more thoughtful and engaging conversations.<br><br><strong>Leave the weather outside.</strong><br>It seems that regardless of context, the ultimate conversation-filler is to talk about the weather. On the surface, that seems fine &#x2026; but do you know anyone who actually enjoys talking about the weather other than Al Roker? Didn&#x2019;t think so.<br>Weather is the fastest way to end a good dialogue, so leave the weather outside (regardless of how frightful it is) and work on other ways to fill awkward gaps in conversation.Unless you&#x2019;re a meteorologist, the chances that you or anyone else has something truly interesting to say about the weather is extremely small.To avoid weather talk, check out <a href=\"http://www.theskimm.com\" target=\"_blank\">TheSkimm</a>, your Twitter feed, or other news sources to find at least two topics more interesting to talk about than precipitation before you arrive at your next event.<br><br>Find yourself stuck in a vortex of weather-talk already? (Sadly, this is an all-too-common occurrence in New England this year.) To get out, switch gears to something more interesting by asking who in the group has a forthcoming vacation plan to escape the weather. Regardless of whether they are heading North, South, East, or West, talking about people&#x2019;s vacations is infinitely more interesting than just talking about the forecast. Plus you might get some good travel recommendations out of it.<br><br>Want to change the subject altogether? Ask everyone in the group which website they visit first when they get up in the morning. Doing so reveals a lot about their personality without being overly revealing&#x2014;and whether it&#x2019;s CNN, Reddit, TechCrunch, US Weekly, or ESPN.com, it helps you understand what your new friends are most passionate about without violating their privacy or confidence. That&#x2019;s a heck of a lot more fun than playing group meteorologist.<br><br><strong>Master the Bridget Jones introduction.</strong><br>In Helen Fielding&#x2019;s Bridget Jones&#x2019; Diary, the book&#x2019;s heroine (Bridget) is a woefully poor conversationalist who makes a resolution to introduce people with thoughtful details. While she may not be a fountain of wisdom for dating advice, her counsel on introductions is extremely wise. Instead of thinking of introductions (of yourself or others) as transactions to be completed&#x2014;&#x201C;Jill, meet Brad, Brad, meet Jill&#x201D;&#x2014;think of them as conversation starters.<br><br>For example, my colleague Lia works on our product marketing team, and I could easily introduce her to someone else accordingly. But for people who don&#x2019;t work at HubSpot or in marketing, that type of introduction doesn&#x2019;t help spark a good conversation. Instead, I typically introduce Lia as having been to nineteen Justin Timberlake concerts in the past year. Doing so inspires reactions from JT fans and haters alike, and it also tees up Lia to tell stories about her travels&#x2014;a much more interesting topic than how long each person in the conversation has been at their respective companies.<br><br>In addition to the quality of your introductions, make it easy for new people to enter the conversation. If you don&#x2019;t know someone by name, give them a chance to jump in based on the topic with something like, &#x201C;We were just discussing the very serious topic of which restaurant in town has the best margaritas. Do you have a strong vote on the matter?&#x201D; <br><br>Making people feel included from the start makes everyone feel more at east, prevents awkward &#x201C;should I or shouldn&#x2019;t I&#x201D; introductions, and ultimately makes it easy for people to come and go seamlessly.<strong>Improv-ise.</strong><br>Tina Fey&#x2019;s book Bossypants outlines some cardinal rules of improvisational comedy, one of which is mastering the &#x201C;yes, and&#x201D; principle. Let me give you an example: Let&#x2019;s say your improv partner states a fact, like &#x201C;the police are here.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s your role as their improv partner to respond first by acknowledging the truth of what he or she is saying, and then by adding to it. Something like, &#x201C;Yes, and who knew they&#x2019;d bring tanks with them, too?&#x201D;<br><br>Responses like this build the storyline for an improv audience&#x2014;and they have a similar impact on real-life conversations. So the next time someone says, &#x201C;Did you see the movie Wild?&#x201D;, don&#x2019;t respond with a simple &#x201C;yes.&#x201D; Follow the queen of comedy, Tina Fey, and offer up something else: &#x201C;I sure did, and I liked it better than Into the Woods. Do you think Reese Witherspoon will get the Oscar?&#x201D; Alternatively, if someone asks if you saw the Super Bowl, don&#x2019;t just nod or shake your head. Give them some direction, either with an &#x201C;I did, and as a Pats fan, I&#x2019;ve never been so grateful the Hawks decided to throw. Can you believe it?&#x201D; Or if the game wasn&#x2019;t your thing, say, &#x201C;Of course&#x2014;I already have my left shark costume for Halloween next year. What are you going to dress up as?&#x201D; &#x201C;Yes, and&#x201D; is a formula for significantly better comedy and conversation, so do the math and plan accordingly.<br><br>Be warned, though: &#x201C;Yes, and&#x201D; can quickly become a vehicle to talk more about yourself&#x2014;but the trick is to do exactly the opposite. Listening is as important as talking, so instead of trying to &#x201C;one-up&#x201D; the people you&#x2019;re chatting with, it forces you to think deliberately about adding value to the conversation and acknowledge their input. Furthermore, thinking about conversations as mini improv sessions also forces you to take more risks. Tina&#x2019;s wisdom rings true here again:&#x201C;You can&#x2019;t be that kid standing at the top of the waterslide, overthinking it. You have to go down the chute.&#x201D;&#xA0;This trope is as true of conversations as it is for other risks in your life: No matter how extroverted you are or how many people you know in a room, everyone still gets nervous in first-day-of-school situations, whether they are personally- or professionally-oriented. So instead of watching people pass and wishing you had spoken up, take a risk, pick a new improv partner, and practice your very best &#x201C;yes, and&#x201D; skills. The absolute worst that can happen is thirty seconds of awkward conversation (which, let&#x2019;s be honest, probably would&#x2019;ve happened anyway).<strong>Learn to be a play-caller.</strong><br>In football, the coaches who call the plays are responsible for reading what&#x2019;s happening in the game and then calling the best play possible for their team given the scenario. They have some set plays they know their players can execute on, and the team (and other coaches) look to them for exactly what to do when time is tight and the stakes are high.<br><br>The best conversationalists become de facto play-callers in conversations: They help bail people out of awkward situations; they know how to switch gears when the chatter takes a turn that is too serious or too personal; they include people in the conversation who may have otherwise been left out of the conversation.<br>The most important step in becoming a play-caller is recognizing that it&#x2019;s not about talking more. In fact, if you&#x2019;re an effective play caller, you might make someone else the star of the show.Instead, becoming a good play-caller means reading a situation well, listening actively, and knowing how to put the spotlight on others without putting them on the spot.Not sure where to start? Try giving someone a genuine and thoughtful compliment. If you&#x2019;re in someone&#x2019;s home, don&#x2019;t just say &#x201C;I love your house.&#x201D; Instead, choose a single item you really like and ask them to tell you the story behind it. This invites them to share more than just a polite &#x201C;thanks so much&#x201D; and often leads to a travel narrative or anecdote that others in the group can relate and add to.Self-deprecating humor also works wonders in a play-calling setting. For example, I&#x2019;ll often offer, &#x201C;Has anyone else already completely botched their New Year&#x2019;s resolution already? I know I have, and it&#x2019;s only going to get worse tonight!&#x201D; When people are uncomfortable, one-upsmanship has a funny way of working its way into the conversation&#x2014;so making fun of yourself makes everything significantly sillier and invites others into the conversation, instead of making them feel like they need to boast or promote themselves.<br><br><strong>Focus on the positive.</strong><br>If people wanted to join the debate team, they&#x2019;d go back to high school. When cocktail parties turn into debates, the only &#x201C;winners&#x201D; are the bartenders&#x2014;because everyone just drinks heavily and goes home earlier. So even if you&#x2019;re stuck talking to the world&#x2019;s biggest party pooper, try to find the silver lining. Then everyone will feel more at ease.<br><br>This is not to say you need to agree with jerks for the sake of polite conversation. If someone offers a rude version of a differing political opinion in a professional setting, I&#x2019;ll typically try to change the subject by saying, &#x201C;Given that debate&#x2019;s been going on for decades, it doesn&#x2019;t seem like one we&#x2019;ll reconcile tonight, so let&#x2019;s focus on a more pressing issue in front of us: where we locate more of those appetizers they had on our way in.&#x201D;<br>Even more tragic than overly politicized conversations are those that put people on the spot. For example, let&#x2019;s say you&#x2019;re in a group networking setting and someone remarks, &#x201C;Gosh, you&#x2019;re still single? I had no idea,&#x201D; or makes an off-putting remark about someone&#x2019;s appearance, health, or awkward family situation.<br><br>As a general rule, make it your goal to have everyone leave a conversation you&#x2019;re in happier or more relaxed than they were when it started.If someone is put on the spot, take an active role in helping them out: Change the subject, crack a joke at your own expense, or offer them a compliment that changes the course of the conversation. That kind of karma comes back to you in spades.<br><br><strong>Don&#x2019;t try to ask all things of all people.</strong><br>Let&#x2019;s face it: It&#x2019;s hard to ask for a job, for money for your startup, or for advice to help accelerate your career. But in order to avert the awkwardness and potential rejection of a one-on-one email or conversation, far too many people try to be all things to all people&#x2014;asking dozens of people for input, advice, or opportunity. You&#x2019;re far better off investing time and energy up front to identify a small group of people, investors, or companies where there is mutual potential value and follow with a thoughtful ask and conversation.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/arlyndavich\" target=\"_blank\">Arlyn Davich,</a> the founder of New York-based startup <a href=\"https://www.payperks.com\" target=\"_blank\">PayPerks</a>, notes, &#x201C;The best kind of investors are those whose expertise you value more than their money. Once you&#x2019;ve identified who those people are, be specific as to what they are uniquely qualified to help you with.&#x201D; So instead of asking your entire LinkedIn network for job advice, or everyone you&#x2019;ve ever met to invest in your business, identify a small cadre of people who can truly impact your decision or influence your success in your industry.<br><br>Don&#x2019;t beat around the bush if you have a clear, concise ask for someone. Just make sure you find an appropriate setting to introduce yourself. (Mid-meal with their family doesn&#x2019;t count, nor does when they are on a conference call). Provide a brief introduction of your background or company, and clarify where you think they can most help and why. Be polite, avoid presumption, and be prompt in your follow-up&#x2014;should they agree to help you out. Above all else, make it easy for others to help you. If they agree to chat, then travel to them, show up on time, and be absurdly and ridiculously prepared when you go.<br><br>I had a friend in college who loved to kick off group conversations by asking how much a polar bear weighed. After some quizzical looks (and the odd guess or too, usually from an engineer or scientist), he would deliver the punch line (&#x201C;enough to break the ice&#x201D;) just in time for some awkward laughs and to get a conversation started. While his joke was horribly cheesy (and occasionally bombed), it&#x2019;s proof that everyone is a little awkward and uncomfortable in conversations with people they don&#x2019;t know.<br><br>All right, folks. The next time you&#x2019;re entering a networking event, showing up for your first day at a new job, arriving at an interview, or attending a housewarming party, you can arrive armed with the tips above. Here&#x2019;s another important insight from another woman I greatly admire: Amy Poehler once said, &#x201C;There&#x2019;s power in looking silly and not caring that you do.&#x201D; So take a risk, strike up a conversation with someone you don&#x2019;t know, and ask an unconventional question. The worst thing that can happen is that it doesn&#x2019;t work and you end up talking about the weather&#x2014;and that was likely going to happen anyway.<br><br>Original posted on <a href=\"https://thinkgrowth.org/how-to-talk-to-pretty-much-anyone-about-pretty-much-anything-94ba60e822e5\" target=\"_blank\">Thinkgrowth.org</a><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"What we can learn from living life on a high.Jon Sundt lost his two&#xA0;younger brothers to drugs. They were very close, just one and two years apart, and the reality of his brothers&#x2019; addiction to drugs was an ongoing struggle&#xA0;for Jon and his family. Rehab didn&#x2019;t work; it was terribly expensive and totally inadequate. After Jon buried his second&#xA0;brother Eric, he thought long and hard about why they chose such a destructive&#xA0;path. It was clear they had bought into a lie that drugs were cool and celebrities&#xA0;and peers, through media&#xA0;and peer pressure, propagated the lie. The Sundt brothers wanted to fit in, they wanted to be &#x201C;cool&#x201D; and they thought, &#x201C;If everybody else&#xA0;is doing it, we should too.&#x201D;<br><br> Bombarded by mixed messages from today&#x2019;s media, kids are exposed&#xA0;to drugs earlier and earlier. Abuse and addiction are widespread problems and our youth are the&#xA0;most vulnerable.&#xA0;Drug abuse derails. It takes you away from your natural highs (like surfing, playing sports, programming, writing, etc.), and it takes you away from your ability to be successful. Jon searched for a way to reach&#xA0;young people with a new message they would&#xA0;listen to before they gave into&#xA0;drugs and peer pressure. He thought about how to connect with them in a different way. Through his search, the answer was on the end of his nose. The answer lives inside of all of us, we&#x2019;re all born with a natural high and it&#x2019;s each of our individual gifts.&#xA0;The challenge, and the opportunity, are to identify and pursue it.<strong>What is your natural high?</strong><br> Close your eyes and imagine yourself doing an activity that you lose track of time with&#x2014;it feels so good that hours feel like minutes and minutes feel like seconds.&#xA0;That is your natural high. Jon started <a href=\"http://www.naturalhigh.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Natural High</a>&#xA0;to&#xA0;bridge the gap between the truth and the lies that surround drug&#xA0;use and addiction. It is focused on combating the false perception of the &#x201C;cool&#x201D; associated with&#xA0;drug use, and instead showcasing the &#x201C;cool&#x201D; associated with celebrities who live drug-free lifestyles. They are spreading a new message about living life on a high and working to create a new social&#xA0;norm, one that empowers youth to find and pursue what they truly love to&#xA0;do, their natural high. They produce a DVD series, an educational&#xA0;curriculum, and outreach&#xA0;campaigns focused on engaging kids and eradicating the drug abuse problem by working to positively influence youth and families&#xA0;to embrace their natural highs and say no to drugs.<br> Natural High has grown from a group of a few passionate&#xA0;individuals working out of Jon&#x2019;s garage to a full-fledged nonprofit organization with a huge footprint. Today Natural High is one of the best drug prevention programs in the&#xA0;country and is currently working with 13,000 (and growing) schools in all 50&#xA0;states, reaching over 6 million youth. The program reaches the hearts and&#xA0;minds of youth in a profound way, and reading the letters and emails from hundreds of students and teachers all over the country brings tears to your eyes. Of the many youth-focused social causes, those who hear the Natural High&#xA0;message in their classrooms are now making their own videos, pledging to live naturally high, and&#xA0;influencing their peers to do the same.<strong>Doing Jiu Jitsu on drugs</strong><br> How many times have you seen a&#xA0;celebrity story that glamorizes drug and alcohol abuse? It makes for&#xA0;juicy sound bites that get played over and over again. But what about the vast&#xA0;majority of celebrities and athletes who don&#x2019;t use drugs? Why don&#x2019;t we hear&#xA0;those stories? What is the &#x201C;naturally high&#x201D; story that will sell? Celebrities&#xA0;are paid to sell soft drinks and endorse products, but they are never paid to say&#xA0;that &#x201C;not doing drugs&#xA0;contributed to my success&#x201D; or &#x201C;if it weren&#x2019;t for music, I&#xA0;would be using drugs.&#x201D; Jon went on a mission to find these celebrities, these&#xA0;heroes, so he could send this message. He asked them to volunteer their time and be filmed talking&#xA0;about the positive choices they made and&#xA0;how it led to success. He called the&#xA0;success story, &#x201C;Natural High.&#x201D; So imagine a young person looking at his hero who says to&#xA0;him or her, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t do drugs, I do &#x201C;my natural high&#x201D;&#x2014;that&#x2019;s the positive message that needs to be shared.<strong>Celebrity ambassadors on a new kind of high</strong><br> Action sports athletes have been obvious partners for Natural High since&#xA0;many of them &#x2018;get high&#x2019; on their surfboards and skateboards. Over the years of trying to connect with youth&#xA0;across the U.S., the team at Natural High has realized&#xA0;how important it is to also enlist the help of traditional&#xA0;athletes, musicians, artists, dancers and more, who have a story and a charisma to share based on&#xA0;living life on their Natural High&#x2014;and most importantly celebrities that are drug free. Drug-free celebrities such as&#xA0;skateboard legend Tony Hawk, motocross legend Travis Pastrana, designer and&#xA0;author Lauren Conrad,&#xA0;skateboarder Terry Kennedy, surfer Laird Hamilton, rocker&#xA0;Cassadee Pope, WNBA star Lisa Leslie, NBA star Mike Conley Jr, and rockers Switchfoot and P.O.D., are the type of celebrities who need to spread the message of &#x201C;Natural High&#x201D; and share their positive influence.<strong>Compelling content is key</strong><br> Natural High&#x2019;s signature&#xA0;program is designed for educators nationwide, and the Natural High DVD series,&#xA0;which includes a film with drug-free celebrity messengers and a curriculum, is provided free to&#xA0;educators. They target youth in schools where they have an opportunity to capture their attention.&#xA0;By 2020 Natural High hopes to reach 12+ million youth with their message with a goal to leap beyond its&#xA0;organizational purpose and morph into a cool, hip lifestyle choice that youth&#xA0;know and embrace. Young&#xA0;people are the ambassadors of cool and if they choose their natural high it&#x2019;ll change our culture.<br><strong> Can a natural high apply to business??</strong><br>In any good business a story has to be told that&#xA0;resonates with the consumer. Youth, families, and educators are Natural High&#x2019;s target market, and when they hear the story it resonates. They share stories that they identify with and when the people they admire are cool. Their &#x201C;coolness&#x201D; is infectious.&#xA0;It&#x2019;s the Madison Avenue technique: you don&#x2019;t tell a teenager&#xA0;not to drink Sprite&#x2014;you tell him how cool it is to drink Coke. Natural High is telling a story that it is cool to be drug-free.??What can other not-for-profits&#xA0;working with teens learn from Natural High??Meet teens where they are in their lives. Embrace their voice while listening to their&#xA0;words and experiences. Think about&#xA0;your message and your messengers. Heroes, peers and teachers have a profound influence on youth, so invite&#xA0;them to into your conversation and enlist&#xA0;them to be your messengers.??What&#x2019;s the ultimate goal??Our goal is to shift and change culture to create a true, new reality for youth. Natural High wants to create a reality where a young person would go to party&#xA0;or concert and when offered drugs or alcohol, he or she will say, &#x201C;No thanks.&#xA0;I&#x2019;m on a natural high.&#x201D; And&#xA0;everyone around will understand&#xA0;what that means and think&#xA0;that is cool.<strong>Are you living your Natural High?&#xA0;??</strong><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

Watson Sr., <em>The World&#x2019;s Greatest Salesman</em>In the 1920&#x2019;s, corporations were in their infancy. The cadre of C-EIEIO&#x2019;s&#x2014;CFO, CIO, COO, CCO, CSO, and CTO&#x2014;that assist today&#x2019;s Chief Executive Officers were non-existent. There was no Chief Marketing Officer position or even the concept of a corporate brand. Chief Executive Officers were leading without historical precedent, learning through trial and error, and leaning on their instincts. One Chief Executive Officer&#x2019;s intuition proved worthy. He laid the foundation for one of the twentieth century&#x2019;s greatest brands&#x2014;<a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/us/en/\">International Business Machines Corporation</a>.IBM&#x2019;s traditional founder, <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/637641/Thomas-J-Watson-Sr\">Thomas J. Watson Sr.</a>, believed his employees could hone a corporate brand. In 1930, he told his employee-owners, &#x201C;There are very few of the people with whom you come in contact who will ever see our factories, our executives or our home offices. Therefore, they judge our company and our ideals by you.&#x201D; He knew that every interaction between his 6,700 employees and their customers would determine IBM&#x2019;s reputation&#x2014;its corporate brand. Watson Sr. trusted that his corporation would eventually be known by the men and women he employed. For long-term success, he looked inside each man, not their exterior.<strong>Internal Qualities Built IBM&#x2019;s External Brand<br></strong>In a day when salesmen were seen more as ruffians than businessmen, Watson Sr. had to find a balance. History records well IBM&#x2019;s fascination with blue suits, white shirts, ties and wing tip shoes. Personal appearance was important to Watson Sr. He told his employees that first impressions are lasting ones but that, although appearances were important, no successful businessman came in a pre-determined package of physical characteristics. They could be, &#x201C;tall or short, corpulent or slight of build, old or young, handsome or homely. In short, they may be almost anything so far as externals are concerned.&#x201D; He focused on what made the person tick on the inside because after the first impression, it was the individual&#x2019;s internal qualities that solidified the customer&#x2019;s perceptions. The blue suit was only intended to open the door; it did not guarantee an ongoing, profitable relationship.History has it wrong. IBM&#x2019;s twentieth century priorities were always on an individual&#x2019;s internal qualities; these qualities just happen to show up on the corporate doorstep packaged in a blue suit. Over the course of the Great Depression, in speeches and writings, Watson Sr. defined the hallmarks of an employee-owner&#x2014;those who would build a corporate brand unlike any other of the century. He was focused maniacally on internals&#x2014;both personal and corporate&#x2014;to achieve a positive external result. Be humble in confidence and courageous in character.At the top of his list of internal characteristics were character and moral courage&#x2014;that which compels a man to do the right thing, when it should be done, no matter how much the physical being shrinks from the task. In contrast to a person&#x2019;s external reputation&#x2014;what people think you are&#x2014;character is who you truly are: it is your moral fiber. Character defines a person as accepting responsibility for their actions and decisions. To Watson Sr., such a quality ensured right over might.<strong>Be Kind and Courteous to Everyone You Meet<br></strong>Expecting courtesy almost seems like a yesteryear&#x2019;s quality. As Watson Sr.&#x2019;s organization grew, he knew that courtesy got things done. His son, Watson Jr. imbedded this concept into one of his basic beliefs&#x2014;respect for the individual. If an organization of a few hundred, a few thousand or hundreds of thousands is to move forward, it takes respect to resolve the conflicts motivated by the underlying passions that permeate ideas and ideals.<strong>Wisdom is Advice that Works <br></strong>Watson Sr. believed there was no &#x201C;saturation point when it comes to education.&#x201D; But he also believed that knowledge not applied was useless. He wanted his employees to strive for wisdom&#x2013;&#x2013;that understanding derived from applying knowledge to achieve an advantage. He encouraged and emboldened the individual&#x2019;s pursuit of wisdom by forgiving thoughtful mistakes. He told his employee-owners that the only person that does not make mistakes is the person that does not try anything.<strong>You Can Lead a Man to Knowledge, But You Can&#x2019;t Make Him Think<br></strong>&#x201C;No man ever attained greatness who did not think for himself,&#x201D; was the standard set by Watson Sr. THINK was the word that decentralized and empowered. This singular word recognized that every customer engagement was unique. No centralized corporate intelligence or standardized rulebook could capture every customer&#x2019;s unique temperament, distinct business situation, future sales opportunities or comprehend the complexities of worldwide social differences; that was left to thinking individuals at the point of engagement. Centralization destroys a brand through the blandness of standardization. Thinking decentralizes and empowers the growth of a brand through individual imagination and creativity.<strong>Character Speaks Louder Than Words<br></strong>If you want your brand to be known for doing what&#x2019;s right, inspire character and moral courage; if you want your brand to be known for getting things done, inspire mutual respect; if you want your brand to be known for powerful forward movement, inspire the pursuit of wisdom; if you want your brand to be known for creativity and imagination, inspire thinking. If you want your brand to be real, focus on your corporation&#x2019;s internal character and your corporate brand and its external reputation will follow.<strong>&#xA0;</strong><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"<strong>Unlock the power of values to mobilize your company and build your brand.<br><br></strong>Every crisis presents opportunities for innovation and new thinking. While the world seems to be facing a fresh crisis every day, whether man-made or by a force of nature, there is one crisis that presents an opportunity that every company should explore: the crisis of values. This is not a theological or political rant; there will be no commentary on&#xA0;America being greedy, self-obsessed, overweight and overdrawn, or post-colonial England being looted and set on fire by soccer thugs and 12 year-olds, or the Greeks refusing to raise their retirement age, but expecting the Germans to bail them out. This is not a critique of government leadership, foreign, fiscal, welfare or educational policies&#x2014;all of which require radical new thinking. Rather, this addresses one simple challenge to corporations and their leaders: Examine your values and what you believe in, make them meaningful, then put them to work inside and outside of your company because you have a responsibility and a significant opportunity to impact positive and meaningful change.<strong>Have you defined what you believe in?&#xA0;Examine and define your values as a company so that they are meaningful, memorable, and support your purpose.<br><br></strong>The vision articulates the change a company hopes to make in the world, the mission is how it plans to get there, and the values define the character of an organization and act as&#xA0;the principles that direct behavior during the journey.&#xA0;After paying the price for an explosive growth strategy, Starbucks&#xA0;lost its way and ended up in a serious crisis. One of the first things Howard Schultz did on his return as CEO was to re-examine the company&#x2019;s soul and its reason for being. He made sure the mission and the values were refreshed and brought back to life.&#xA0;When Bono spoke at an all-company meeting to announce the roll-out in New Orleans, he said, &#x201C;Some people say, markets are not about morals, they are about profits. That&#x2019;s old thinking and false advice. Great companies will be the ones that find a way to have, and hold on to, their values while chasing their profits. Brand value will converge to create a new business model that unites&#xA0;commerce and compassion, the heart, and the wallet.&#x201D;&#xA0;Today the company is refocused and refreshed with its share price at an all-time high, and everything it does ladders back to its&#x2019; mission and is guided by living and meaningful values.<strong>Engage your team by sharing the values with every department in the company to build ownership and engagement.&#xA0;<br><br></strong>Like countries, companies with unclear values leave the engagement of their people to chance, whereas values-driven companies are organic and function with passion and focus.&#xA0;As individuals, we are what we believe in and companies are what their people believe in.&#xA0;Values that live on a wall in a conference room are often lengthy and forgettable, but shared values that are alive and authentic&#xA0;drive conviction, consistency, and clarity.&#xA0;Integrating values and a connection to human needs into a company&#x2019;s business model, and throughout each department, presents significant opportunities for innovation. Values connect and motivate people, and can supercharge teams with energy and commitment in tough times. They&#xA0;are the lifeblood of a culture, and are what brings a company to life.&#xA0;Do you know your company and brand values? Have you shared the values your company lives by?<strong>Operationalize your values in every department to challenge them to develop action-based plans.<br><br></strong>Having a clear set of values provides a common communications platform and a set of routines that help connect all departments and reduce organizational complexity. It gives people a basis for collaboration&#x2014;a common vocabulary, a common language, and a common set of principles for&#xA0;decision-making.&#xA0;While the world might be changing, values that remain constant provide a foundation for stability and growth. Values people care about inspire them to look for new problems to solve and to keep anticipating change.&#xA0;Have you shared your values with each department in the company and asked them to develop plans to bring them to life?<strong>Develop simple methods to measure the impact of living values and find appropriate ways to celebrate them regularly.<br><br></strong>We know that when people buy products they build emotional connections with brands. For brands to make connections they have to express meaningful values.&#xA0;Like the dynamics of a deep and lasting friendship, these&#xA0;connections are made stronger when common values are clear and present.&#xA0;Values are people-centered beliefs that connect people and groups inside of a company with different skills in different departments as well as consumers outside with the brand.&#xA0;Shared values that are demonstrated in choices and behaviors from a company create opportunities to engage and inspire people inside and outside of the organization.Have you celebrated your values and the impact they have on the company&#x2019;s culture and its performance?<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span><em>Photo: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/26504592@N03/4126493208/\" target=\"_blank\">Flickr</a></em>"

       "content_body":"Laurence McCahill is the co-founder of <a href=\"http://www.thehappystartupschool.com/\">The Happy Startup School</a>, the uncommon startup school that helps people bring their ideas to life. He spends his time helping people question their passions, their reasons for doing things, and even themselves and their abilities. He is damn good at asking damn good questions. Questions that make you think, and perhaps even consider, why your answer is what it is.McCahill framed 10 questions most entrepreneurs are too afraid to ask themselves.Entrepreneurship isn&#x2019;t easy. There are undoubtedly easier ways to earn a living. But, if like Laurence, you&#x2019;re a terrible employee and would rather inject your eyeballs with vodka than work for someone else, then you don&#x2019;t have too many other options. Before taking your first step, really consider why you want to be your own boss. What&#x2019;s driving this big idea? Whose needs will it serve? By taking time to reflect on, and define the purpose behind your idea, you&#x2019;ll not only attract the right customers but you&#x2019;ll also get more clarity as to what you should be working on. It will help you to know what&#x2019;s in and what&#x2019;s out.Constraints are your friend. At the beginning the world will be your oyster, but this can mean too many options. And one of the things that kills energy at the beginning is procrastinating over making decisions. True innovation happens when the options are limited &#x2013; fewer resources breeds creativity. So, work out which constraints are your friend. Got kids? Then base your new working life around school hours. Hate office politics? Build a remote team. See these limitations as a positive, not negative and you&#x2019;ll develop better ideas faster.Put a stake in the ground. The HSS Home School program advised all the startups they work with to make a list of things they&#x2019;ll never do. Often founders find it hard to think of their values, but find it easier to decide upfront what it is that would clash with their vision for their life and business. For instance, at The Happy Startup School they&#x2019;ll never run an event in a conference center (they prefer mountains). They&#x2019;ll never hire someone they wouldn&#x2019;t want to go on holiday with. And they&#x2019;ll never choose work over family commitments. These pledges will help to highlight what&#x2019;s important to you, and ultimately lead you to the values you hold dear and clarity on what matters.Building your true fans. If you&#x2019;re to build a successful business, you&#x2019;ll need people to buy your product or service. But sometimes people end up serving audiences that they can&#x2019;t relate to or even like. The HSS community is proof that if you love the people you&#x2019;re working for and understand their world, then the bonds you create will be unbreakable? and will lead to loyalty unprecedented in the business world.Find your tribe. If there&#x2019;s one thing first-time entrepreneurs underestimate it&#x2019;s the loneliness you can feel when putting your heart (and money) on the line. So, it&#x2019;s crucial that you have some soulmates who understand you. You can have loving friends and family but more often than not they don&#x2019;t understand what it takes to go against the grain and do something different. So, surround yourself with likeminded people who will be your support in the early stages and beyond.&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve found my tribe. A space to learn from beauties&#x2014;teachers, buddies, mentors&#x2014;that see amazingness in other people&#x2019;s nuttiness.&#x201D; Rula, London&#xA0;Resilience is key. If you really believe in your idea, then you&#x2019;ll have to persevere even when everyone around you thinks you&#x2019;re insane. There&#x2019;s a fine line between belief and delusion, but you&#x2019;ll know when the time is right to walk away. Don&#x2019;t let others decide this for you. Some of the most successful businesses hit rock bottom and spent years hustling before they became an &#x2018;overnight&#x2019; success.All great things take time. Would you want to do this if money was no object? Is this an obsession that won&#x2019;t go away? I&#x2019;ve had tons of ideas for businesses, but only when I ask myself this question do I get a clearer sense of my commitment to this idea. We tested out many ideas before The Happy Startup School. But when this came to us, it had to happen. As the vision was so strong, we had firm belief the money would follow.Think like a detective. Despite what many people think, entrepreneurs aren&#x2019;t great risk takers. If anything, they&#x2019;re more cautious than most?&#x2014;?they hate failure but see it as part of the creative process. They want to make any failures small, so therefore work hard at the beginning &#x2013; not to be proven right &#x2013; but to be proven wrong. They know that bad news gets worse the longer you leave it. So the sooner you can find out issues with your product, the faster you can improve and reach your goals.Happiness comes from solving problems. To increase your chances of success, create a painkiller, not a vitamin &#x2013; every great problem is a great opportunity. Consider which problem you want to take on. What pain do you want to own that others experience? Apurva Kothari didn&#x2019;t want to start a business. He knew nothing about clothing. But he started No Nasties to play his part in addressing the cotton farmer suicide crisis affecting India, where to date 300,000 famers have lost their lives unnecessarily.Put on your own life jacket first. If you&#x2019;re too stick at it and have fuel for the long haul, you&#x2019;ll need to look after number 1. How will you look after yourself physically and mentally? Whether it&#x2019;s mindfulness, yoga, walking your dog or floating in a ton of salt, you&#x2019;ll need to find your thing to get the perspective and space you need to stay calm, clear and sane.The most important thing? Just start starting things. You never know where it will take you but it will be a fun ride. And you&#x2019;ll have some stories to tell the grandkids of stuff you did, rather than didn&#x2019;t do.<a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/empowering-people-to-bring-their-ideas-to-life\">Read our full Interview with Laurence McCahill here</a>&#xA0;Original Post: <a href=\"/%20https:/medium.com/the-happy-startup-school/10-questions-to-ask-your-crazyfuckerself-if-2017-is-to-be-your-year-33e3ff8e269a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Medium</a><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"&#x201C;Stop moving around. Would you please sit STILL! The more you move around, the longer it&#x2019;s going to take!&#x201D; I remember the day as if it were yesterday&#x2014;not a shot at the doctor&#x2019;s office or a cavity at the dentist. It was the dreaded family photo.It&#x2019;s the 1970s and as a very young (active) boy, I&#x2019;d like to think almost anyone could relate to my situation. At a time when my main responsibility was to play, eat, then play again, the thought of being still for any given period of time felt punitive&#x2014;or at least unreasonable. Really, who would care if I was looking at the camera or not? To make matters worse, my mom was compelled to torture me and get a shot with one of my hands clasped together with hers in her lap.If this photo was simply of my family, or if we could jettison today&#x2019;s digital technology back into the moment, I think I could&#x2019;ve made the effort to make this successful. However, this wasn&#x2019;t just our family&#x2014;it was THE family: over fifteen people dressed in clothes we normally don&#x2019;t wear, cramped together under hot lights with powdered faces to eliminate glare from shiny foreheads. I would have rather gotten a shot than try to get &#x201C;the shot.&#x201D; With Adobe still being a dream that wouldn&#x2019;t exist for another decade, the Photoshop of the day was simply taking more photos. If minutes felt like hours and hours felt like days, this was a week. The more I tried to not think about moving, the more I moved. It took F O R E V E R.Fast forward to today, and through much to the chagrin of my parents and extended family members, I may have actually been the tip of the spear helping all of us avoid the hidden crisis of today&#x2014;<em>Death by Chair.</em>We are all living with an epidemic that a majority of us ignore every day. The issue is not that different and actually has a strange correlation to the distressed turnaround work I&#x2019;ve done over the past twenty years. Sitting still is not good for your business or personal health.In June of 2011, CNN published an article titled, <em><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/06/24/sitting.shorten.life/index.html\">Sitting For Hours Can Shave Years Off Life</a>.</em> Did you know about this? Neither did I. Thanks to Dr. Tim Brown of <a href=\"http://www.intelliskin.net/\" target=\"_blank\">IntelliSkin</a>, a technical apparel company that uses Smart Compression, this Newport Beach based company has educated me on the need for movement and improved posture. In summary, the article reported that the American Cancer Society studied 123,216 people&#x2019;s health outcomes during a 14-year period and found that women who sat for more than six hours a day were approximately 40% more likely to die during the course of the study than those who sat fewer than three hours per day. Men it looks better for us: approximately 20% of us could take the dirt nap during that same period of time. However, we are only talking death here (insert your own variation of the Princess Bride quote, &#x201C;<em>Never mess with <span>movement</span> when death is on the line)</em>.Other studies have focused on cardiovascular disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes and depression. As you can predict, sitting increased the risk of illness here as well, and it only gets worse. The American Journal of Epidemiology published a study finding people who worked sedentary jobs had almost twice the risk of a specific type of colon cancer. (You may want to stand and read the rest of this post right about now.)Now some of you may already be thinking, I work out, spend hours doing cardio and strengthening my core. I put my body in awkward positions in searing heat that must help neutralize some of the negative effects of my extended sitting. Well, more bad news for you. Recent research shows that extended sitting, much like smoking, can&#x2019;t be undone by exercising. Everyone, from the American College of Sports Medicine and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, have shifted gears to include guidelines that address not just physical activity, but physical inactivity. Incorporating ergonomic stand-up and treadmill desks in the workplace are on the rise, but nowhere near the norm, and most people are simply not educated in understanding how harmful sitting is to your overall health.Your business may also be suffering from poor movement and posture. The simple things to help address the problem are usually the things we run right past. So, as difficult as it is to just think about the activity portion for your health, here are five tips for you (and your business) think about regarding the inactive consequences.<strong>1. Stretch</strong><br> It&#x2019;s important to get up every half hour for a couple of minutes for some full body stretching and deep breathing. This helps promote circulation and increase your metabolism.To win, you need to stretch your business. Do you have a compelling purpose and vision that connects to goals and objectives that stretch your business? Not impossible goals, but goals that expand the creative thinking towards accomplishing your company&#x2019;s purpose and vision.<strong>2. Move</strong><br> That stiffness and pain you feel after sitting for an extended period of time is a result of your muscles turning off. Take a quick walk around the building or office area every hour or two to get the blood and oxygen flowing.If businesses didn&#x2019;t stagnate or get complacent, I might be out of a job. Fortunately (or unfortunately) it&#x2019;s very common. Businesses plateau and the easiest time for competitors to take your market share is when the target is not moving. Are you thinking about how they might steal your best customer or shave 10% off your market share (think Kodak or Nokia)? They are.<strong>3. Moderation</strong><br> As Oscar Wilde once said, &#x201C;Everything in moderation, including moderation.&#x201D; Anything in excess is usually not a good thing. You can sit, but shoot for shorter periods of time and establish a rhythm. At a minimum, be cognizant of the amount of time you&#x2019;re sitting (driving/meetings) and have an equal plan for the amount of time you should be stretching and moving.Proper pacing and rhythm in business is critical. Stretch targets and changing a business&#x2019; scope cannot be completed tomorrow, so be realistic in setting expectations. Your team(s) will support and work hard to achieve reasonable stretch goals and you&#x2019;ll be further ahead than if you didn&#x2019;t set a target. If you&#x2019;re committed to being unrealistic, be prepared to fail.<strong>4. Flexibility</strong>Be open to trying something new and find ways to improve your muscle imbalances. A physio ball instead of a chair or a stand-up workstation may be a good start, but don&#x2019;t forget movement. I tried yoga and plyometrics but I love <a href=\"http://www.foundationtraining.com/\" target=\"_blank\">FoundationTraining.com</a> and use it throughout the day.Be flexible in your strategy and explore the various ways to solve the same problem. Be careful not to marry a mistake and allow for healthy debate and spirited dialogue to pivot the business to a better place.<strong>5. Responsibility</strong><br> Take ownership over your health, get educated and make the necessary changes. Don&#x2019;t be a victim. You may have no choice with your commute, but you do not have to sit in every meeting. You can stand, stretch, and move&#x2026; try it!It&#x2019;s amazing the excuses you hear when a company starts to fail. It&#x2019;s always someone else&#x2019;s fault. The market shifted, labor was expensive, supply chain cost increased, sales couldn&#x2019;t sell and manufacturing couldn&#x2019;t produce on time with good quality&#x2014;it never changes. The competitors you face don&#x2019;t care, and they won&#x2019;t be the same competitors tomorrow. Winners are winners because they take responsibility and embrace accountability.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

Billions of dollars, time, and R&amp;D are being invested into the IT ecosystem and positive bottom line results are the rule and not the exception.

Regarding the latter, ideas and concepts may be taken from areas not normally associated in defined verticals (Banking &amp; Finance, Pharmaceutical, Information Technology, etc.) to open new paths that could lead to improved coordination across many areas involved in the delivery process.<strong>Some projects are best completed solo, while others succeed by aligning partnerships </strong>From a strategic standpoint (corporate or otherwise), leaders and project managers should ask themselves if a specific project or effort could benefit by engaging with folks/companies with similar goals and interests, or if it&#x2019;s best to go solo. Organizations should first evaluate the project and decide if other partners are needed. The more elements, the more complexity, and more variables (e.g., part shortages, production disruptions, etc.) to consider. Conversely, enlisting trusted partners could increase bandwidth to better deal with highly complicated efforts such an inversion project, which requires careful coordination from the Program Office to the developers at ground level.As a result, organizations must carefully evaluate if partners are needed, and how many should be added into the mix to achieve maximum efficiency. Take, for example, the building of a server from a hardware perspective. Company A wants to create a commodity-type x86 offering and can fully create the product in-house (except for the processor), while being competitive. Company B, on the other hand, wants to assemble the same type of offering, but does not manufacture any of the internal components and must rely entirely on partners to supply the needed hardware (e.g., processors, hard drives, memory, etc.), which allows for market forces to dictate both price and availability. This path leaves Company B open to a number of additional uncertainties like if a supplier goes into bankruptcy or decides not to provide the number or quality level of units originally agreed upon. Accordingly, Company B would be advised to have a well thought-out Contingency Plan in place if the uncertainty scenarios materialize.As logic would dictate, the more partners, the greater reliance of a carefully crafted plan that takes into consideration certain key variables such as the swapping of main partners without disrupting the overall project or effort.<strong>Orchestrate your strategy</strong>Creating a solid business and coherent strategy is much like building a symphony orchestration. The organization of the various pieces takes place, which in essence is the coming together or synchronization of a group to achieve the desired goal or objective. It is imperative that business leaders be open-minded and not only leverage well known and proven methodologies, but also ideas and concepts outside the box.An excellent example of leveraging of old and new is Eroica (Symphony #3) by Beethoven. He wanted to break away from his predecessor, Mozart, and works like Symphony 41. Unfortunately Beethoven&#x2019;s 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Symphonies seemed far too similar in overall tone to be considered revolutionary. In retrospect Beethoven decided to break new ground in 1804 and 1805 with his masterpiece, the 3<sup>rd</sup>. He tried to leverage most of the structural points of prior works, but added a kaleidoscope of shadings to create something truly revolutionary in the Second Movement. The effects are both profound and captivating in its delivery and ability to hit the inner core of people&#x2019;s emotions. The idea was to not only create a groundbreaking piece, but a new form of music, while putting the framework in place to achieve his goal&#x2014;hundreds of components (e.g., sheet music, players, instruments, etc.) with precise timing.It is here where a connection to orchestrating can be made. A carefully crafted strategic plan should be put into place, as well as the implementation of the supporting plans (performance &amp; contingency) to help achieve the desired result or objective. The ability to create an offering that is both widely accepted and profitable requires not only an &#x201C;ear to the ground&#x201D;, but also technical prowess combined with sensitivity to various players including end-users, employees, and external partners. Key Performance Indicators (KPI&#x2019;s) should be included in the Performance Plan along with &#x201C;what if scenarios&#x201D; that visualize possible future trends or events in a well-defined Contingency Plan. Fast forward to the ontological world where KPI&#x2019;s lead the future allowing for Artificial Intelligence (AI) to come into play so that thousands, or even millions, of &#x201C;what if scenarios&#x201D; can be evaluated and the best ones chosen to better foretell the future.Mozart taught us to know our audience. Case in point, Mozart broke with traditional operas in Italian and decided that German would more appealing to his Viennese audience. Hence, since we are in a global economy, people and organizations must not only take domestic factors in to consideration, but a World View as well.From a pragmatic point of view, we must first see if we should strategizing on our own or are we to include others components (e.g., partners, peers, employees, etc.) into the equation. Accordingly, once the agreed upon path is chosen then the pieces must be assembled to reach the desired goals and objectives. <em>Patience is a virtue</em> is a term that is often used, but in our fast paced world <em>time is of the essence</em> may be more applicable. Doing what you can do now to leverage new ideas and concepts within a strategic framework could be the action theme going forward.Consider these six Uncommon Sense questions to ask yourself as you Orchestrate Your Business Strategy.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Meet Susanna Finnell and Brewster McCracken, two individuals with novel visions for reducing carbon footprints. Knowing that the government isn&#x2019;t likely to spark provocative thinking or creative solutions, these two entrepreneurial-minded individuals each crafted an approach to applying the lessons of sustainable living&#x2014;one based on a change in individual lifestyle and the other designed to shift an entire community. Both Susanna and Brewster grabbed the baton from government and took individual action aimed at reinventing America&#x2019;s electric system.Susanna and Brewster prove that it&#x2019;s the people who tip the scales for change and translate issues that a government believes would make a powerful impact into game-changing action. They leveraged tax rebates and subsidies as well as other government-designed provisions, and brought them to life in unusual and provocative ways.In 2008, Brewster McCracken was living in Austin, Texas where he had served two terms on City Council. One day he and a small group of colleagues came up with a novel idea: Why not go a step beyond governmental policy that attempted to legislate greater energy efficiency and actually build the equivalent of a huge Petri dish to experiment with what would really drive lower energy use? Why not try to engage the entire community in grassroots-led efforts in reducing Austin&#x2019;s carbon footprint and speed up the pace of change?&#x201C;As a country we&#x2019;d been wrestling with what the killer apps might be in the areas of clean energy and sustainability. But we didn&#x2019;t have a living laboratory to test what really works. How could we find out how real people make day-to-day choices about energy use? Based on those questions, I helped to create Pecan Street&#x2014;a smart-grid test community that sharpens everyone&#x2019;s focus on how to reduce energy consumption.&#x201D;Today, <a href=\"http://www.pecanstreet.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Pecan Street</a> is a multi-faceted, rapidly growing project that includes participation by hundreds of families who have signed up to have their houses and vehicles monitored to study electricity use. The families have the option of using electric vehicles, newly-designed smart devices, and an array of gizmos created to support low-energy living. They can turn off their lights from their smart phones, watch their energy consumption patterns in great detail, figure out which times of day are best for washing clothes or dishes, giving Pecan Street participants the opportunity to evaluate, rethink, and reconfigure their energy use. Families plug in their cars, monitor their homes, and share their energy use information with the entire community.McCracken is the Pecan Street&#x2019;s Executive Director and works with collaborators from the University of Texas who monitor the energy, corporate partners including Freescale, Green Mountain Energy, Intel, Landis+Gyr, LG Electronics, Lockheed Martin, Oncor, Onstar, Oracle, Sony, SunEdison, Texas Gas Service, and Whirlpool who apply the research findings to the design of energy efficient products. The result is an entirely new mindset about the electric grid.<strong>People make change. Governments can help fund it.</strong><br> Is it the people or government leaders who deserve credit for the change that&#x2019;s occurring in Austin&#x2019;s Pecan Street experiment today? It could be argued that government played a key role since they supported Pecan Street&#x2019;s 2008 vision through a $10.4 million grant from the Department of Energy in 2009. However, rarely does one hear that the government is responsible for getting people excited about shifting their energy use. For the engagement and reinforcement, it&#x2019;s all about the people&#x2014;one hundred percent.Susanna Finnell is a recent convert to the Pecan Street way of life. She grew up in Switzerland, where she was fiercely aware of energy constraints. Energy wasn&#x2019;t abundant and it was expensive. She remembers that one time the government in Switzerland even tried to motivate people to turn off their lights at night by staging a night light conservation contest between two cities. But according to Susanna, contests and government policy can only go so far. After moving to Austin, Texas, she was inspired so she plugged into the city&#x2019;s energy-efficient values and she decided to do something radical&#x2014;live in a house that was carbon-neutral, using solar panels to generate enough electricity to power her energy needs.<strong>Susanna turned to Pecan Street for a sense of community and guidance.</strong><br> Government can tell you that it&#x2019;s good to conserve energy, but you need a level of detail that most utility companies can&#x2019;t provide and you need daily reinforcement for staying the course. The Pecan Street project supplies both.Energy rebates have definitely played a part in making Susanna&#x2019;s financial equation balance, but it wasn&#x2019;t the government subsidies that inspired her carbon-neutral decisions. &#x201C;The rebates on solar panels helped, but my real inspiration has come from the realization that I can change my energy use patterns and have such a dramatic impact. We live our lives as if electricity is free and infinite, but once we see that air conditioning costs can be reduced by more than a third, it might makes us wonder&#x2014;what else I can do?&#x201D;Pecan Street is setting a new standard in Austin and becoming one of the city&#x2019;s local heroes. They just won the <a href=\"http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Awards/BestOfAustin?Award=1362853\" target=\"_blank\">Austin Chronicle&#x2019;s</a> award for <a href=\"http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Awards/BestOfAustin?Award=1362853\" target=\"_blank\">The Best Way to Turn Some Green Even Greener</a>, citing the powerful results they&#x2019;ve achieved in just three years&#x2019; time:&#x201C;By offering rebates to participants, the project has helped to solar-power the Mueller neighborhood, which now boasts over 200 homes with rooftop systems and the highest concentration of electric cars in the nation.&#x201D;Pecan Street represents the new world order, where the intent of the government is embraced by communities connecting with people on a deeper level. They provide the missing link between policy and passion, tapping into the creativity of individuals like Susanna Finnell and thousands of other people who want to play a meaningful role in rethinking the electric grid. In the end, government can set the course, but it takes impassioned people to make the impact.<em> <br></em><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Situated in the lobby of 150 North Riverside, Chicago&#x2019;s exclusive new commercial tower, a stunning video canvas of more than 3,000 square feet serves as a dynamic digital sculpture for tenants and visitors alike. Dubbed 150 Media Stream, the permanent installation features commissioned works by both established and budding artists from across the globe.Our partners at Leviathan designed the permanent <u><a href=\"http://www.lvthn.com/work/video-installation/\">kinetic art installation</a></u> to create a visual experience that remains engaging throughout the day, week and month. We had an opportunity to talk with Chad Hutson, President of Leviathan, about the project, their innovative technology applications and what makes the installation so special.<strong>Bulldog Drummond: Tell us about 150 Media Stream</strong><strong>Chad Hutson: </strong>150 Media Stream is a kinetic art installation conceived by the property development team of Chicago highrise 150 N. Riverside, which is headquarters to tenants Hyatt, William Blair and Navigant Consulting. Situated in the lobby, this permanent digital installation features commissioned works by artists. To avoid excessive repetition, Leviathan has designed an intelligent content library that continually transforms over time and empowers 150 Media Stream&#x2019;s curators with maximum visual flexibility. Using generative algorithms to heighten originality and relevance, the system is programmed to address seasonal, monthly, weekly, daily and even real-time considerations.<strong>BD: What sets this project/space apart from similar spaces?</strong><strong>CH:</strong> Representing a giant leap forward for public art initiatives, this reactive installation (which responds to external factors like time of day, weather, the lobby&apos;s activity level, special events and tenant considerations) constitutes Chicago&apos;s largest video wall, while also providing exciting new exhibition opportunities for both world-renowned and student artists.The art installation&#x2019;s massive 3,000+ square foot canvas is comprised of 89 individual vertical LED displays of various heights and widths, as well as integration of negative space between each blade.<strong>BD: Did you collaborate on the project?</strong><strong>CH:</strong> The client had an excellent curator on staff, Yuge Zhou, who we enjoyed collaborating with. The original designers of the display hardware, McCann Systems, were critical partners in engineering some complex technological solutions.<strong>BD: What made this project special</strong><strong>CH:</strong> For us, this was a particularly creative project, as there were no logos or brand guidelines to take into consideration. This was merely creating flexible and well-curated art, as well as enabling other artists to upload their own works.<strong>BD: What was innovative about your solution (for this type of project/client)?</strong><strong>CH: </strong>From what we&#x2019;ve seen on other video walls throughout the world, content that is pre-created does look beautiful and impressive, though it can repeat so often that it becomes less memorable to those that see it every day, such as office tenants. An ever-evolving but still elegant generative solution &#x2013;one that can easily be modified on-the-fly by us or our clients&#x2013; is something we&#x2019;ve not seen before, particularly in the context of an art installation.<strong>BD: What are the unique social or cultural impacts this project will have on the community or users?</strong><strong>CH:</strong> The people of Chicago and the global artistic community are already coming together around this particular project, both physically and digitally (see #150mediastream). Adding a very exciting new dimension to Chicago&#x2019;s skyline and the lives of residents, with 150 Media Stream, 150 North Riverside is also providing inspiration in the realms of art, high tech and innovation.To learn more about 150 Media Stream visit <u><a href=\"http://150mediastream.com/\">http://150mediastream.com</a></u>.<strong>More about our friends at Leviathan<br></strong><a href=\"http://www.lvthn.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Leviathan</a> is a specialized creative agency working at the nexus of design, digital media and interaction.

       "principle":"INNOVATION IS HARD",
       "content_body":"The importance of innovation is increasing each year. Some companies are establishing their internal and external innovation teams, focusing more on <a href=\"http://www.game-changer.net/2015/03/02/what-a-culture-of-innovation-looks-like/\" target=\"_blank\">developing a culture of innovation</a>. This is a change. It is not easy. Resistance can occur due to some practical and psychological reasons inside the organization.Innovation isn&#x2019;t easy. If it were, then wouldn&#x2019;t be having debates about &#x201C;<a href=\"http://www.game-changer.net/2016/04/19/maintainers-not-innovators-make-the-world-turn/\" target=\"_blank\">how we need less innovation but more of the same</a>&quot;. The truth is established businesses can and must innovate, but <a href=\"http://www.game-changer.net/2010/10/09/innovation-book-review-stoking-your-innovation-bonfire/\" target=\"_blank\">there are challenges they must overcome</a>.There are various <a href=\"http://ssir.org/articles/entry/8_common_innovation_traps\" target=\"_blank\">innovation traps</a> related to execution and implementation, as well as conceptual rooted in the way organizations think about what innovation is and what it can achieve:Solving all of these issues and establishing a well working innovation management system will support the growth of company and it will create a good customer value and profitability. But they have to develop and improve their system continuously to protect their competitive advantage.Below I elaborate on some of these common innovation challenges and provide some guidance on how to solve them:<strong>1.&#xA0;Prove it</strong>These are <a href=\"http://www.game-changer.net/2013/12/04/innovation-asking-two-deadliest-words-business/#.V5_Y62U3foo\" target=\"_blank\">the two most dangerous words in innovation</a>, where senior management wants to make sure an idea will work before it is launched into the market. I believe this is the greatest sign that an organization is not aligned and organized to become innovative, because it impedes progress by deliberately blocking ideas that don&#x2019;t fit the status quo.Again in larger corporations, there is a reluctance to put new to the world products into the hands of consumers until the product has been fully optimized and tested, because of fear of failure (again a short term reward structure problem). My preference, however, is to get prototypes in the hands of consumers as soon as possible, even mock-ups, so I can begin learning as soon as possible incorporating consumer feedback as early in the innovation process as possible (let&#x2019;s start with drawings and descriptions and then move to mock-ups, then looks like/ feels like prototypes, and then sub optimized prototypes, etc.). Give the consumer a little credit.The bottom line is you can&#x2019;t analyze your way into the future; you have try.Solving this challenge:&#xA0;Experiment, that is the <a href=\"http://www.game-changer.net/2013/11/27/the-shortest-path-to-innovation/\" target=\"_blank\">shortest path to innovation</a>. Nowadays it&#x2019;s quite easy to <a href=\"http://www.game-changer.net/2014/03/17/3-lessons-about-how-to-do-rapid-prototyping-from-the-nordstrom-innovation-lab/\" target=\"_blank\">prototype and validate new ideas in real-time</a> and in a very short amount of time, which then can give you insight into what will and won&#x2019;t work.The point is to be wrong as fast as possible so you&#x2019;ll know what doesn&#x2019;t work faster.<strong>2. Underestimating what it takes</strong>Innovation is messy, it doesn&#x2019;t happen in a straight line. Breakthroughs take years, but senior management wants to see results quickly, but most organizations are not organized to make long-term bets.Innovation doesn&#x2019;t happen overnight and senior management in larger corporations is rewarded by today&#x2019;s results and because of this it is hard to get backing for innovation programs because of their long term nature.The safe bet is that for something truly game-changing to be adopted you have to keep your expectations in check.Solving this challenge:&#xA0;Adopt a venture capitalist mindset, think long-term and plan on spending more than you think.<strong>3. Coming to consensus</strong><a href=\"http://www.game-changer.net/2015/05/01/consensus-kills-innovation/\" target=\"_blank\">Consensus kills innovation</a>. It is common in risk averse organizations, it happens when people try to build group consensus about which new ideas it should support. This type of decision making can lead to supporting and funding only the safest ideas, while dismissing radical projects that could transform the business outright.<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/10/the-most-innovative-companies-dont-worry-about-consensus/\" target=\"_blank\">The most innovative companies don&#x2019;t worry about consensus</a>. Rather here <a href=\"http://www.game-changer.net/2011/10/12/ideas-trump-hierarchy/#.V5_ZhWU3foo\" target=\"_blank\">ideas trump hierarchy</a>, and they embrace passionate discussions on what the best ideas are; not what everyone else is doing.Solving this challenge:&#xA0;There are various ways to kill consensus, the most useful one is to be led by ideas rather than hierarchy. By doing so, you are open to outside inspiration and new perspectives that will challenge your world view.<strong>4. Who&#x2019;s responsible for innovation</strong>It&#x2019;s not everyone,&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.game-changer.net/2016/01/22/innovation-isnt-a-job/#.V5_b0GU3foo\" target=\"_blank\">it&#x2019;s not a job</a>&#xA0;and <a href=\"http://www.game-changer.net/2016/01/22/innovation-isnt-a-job/#.V5_b0GU3foo\" target=\"_blank\">you can&#x2019;t mandate people to do it</a>. Yes, everyone can innovate; but not everyone will or want to.Typically, organizations want to embed innovation activities in the day to day but it&#x2019;s of no use if people are not given the time to actually do things that have nothing to do with the day to day.Another approach is to create separate teams that are not bogged down by the day to day activities, such as X from Alphabet, and let them focus on the long-term risky bets.Accountability is important, and ultimately <a href=\"http://www.game-changer.net/2015/05/14/without-great-leadership-there-is-no-innovation/#.V5_cD2U3foo\" target=\"_blank\">without leadership there is no innovation</a>.Solving this challenge:&#xA0;There is not set way to solve this challenge, some organizations like Intuit have been able to c<a href=\"http://www.game-changer.net/2013/11/20/how-nnovation-happens-at-intuit/#.V5_cLWU3foo\" target=\"_blank\">reate a dedicated group of innovators</a> that acts as support for the larger core business as well as teams focused on new ideas.Is it a model that will work for everyone? No. You need to figure out what will work for you.What you can do to <a href=\"http://www.game-changer.net/2013/03/13/10-ways-leaders-can-ignite-innovation/#.V5_cT2U3foo\" target=\"_blank\">organically drive innovation</a> is create the conditions where people can express and try new ideas without punishment; reward initiative and learning.Ultimately, leaders need to <a href=\"http://www.game-changer.net/2015/06/15/the-new-leadership-challenge-create-a-context-in-which-others-can-innovate/#.V5_cXWU3foo\" target=\"_blank\">actively create the conditions</a> and drive innovation into the organization by role-modeling the right behaviors (e.g. accountability, ambiguity and risk acceptance, experimentation, etc).&#xA0;<strong>5. Reframing beliefs</strong>What got you here won&#x2019;t get you there, <a href=\"http://www.game-changer.net/2012/06/21/what-pixars-secret-consistent-success/#.V5_crGU3foo\" target=\"_blank\">success breeds failure</a>. And previous success get people to develop tunnel vision, get stuck in their ways and become risk averse to anything that challenges their beliefs; thus <a href=\"http://www.game-changer.net/2014/03/20/the-sad-truth-about-how-innovation-dies-in-large-organizations/\" target=\"_blank\">innovation dies without any air time</a>.Solving this challenge:&#xA0;Innovation is as much about attitude and perspective as it is about process, so start by <a href=\"http://www.game-changer.net/2016/05/19/heres-a-great-workshop-exercise-to-help-your-leadership-team-challenge-their-beliefs-assumptions/#.V5_cxmU3foo\" target=\"_blank\">questioning your assumptions</a>, as well as the beliefs you have of what drives success in your industry.<strong>6. Getting metrics right, especially for radical innovations</strong>Related to challenge #2, senior management underestimates what it takes to get it done. But more importantly, assumptions on how to measure progress.<strong>7. Not invented here</strong>Not all the smart people work for you. By leveraging the discoveries of others, your organization can produce spectacular results.The best ideas and innovations are probably not invented by your organization. But learning to find and work with outsiders calls for a massive cultural change, beginning with getting past the &#x201C;not invented here&#x201D; syndrome.The <a href=\"https://www.techopedia.com/definition/3848/not-invented-here-syndrome-nihs\" target=\"_blank\">Not Invented Here Syndrome</a> has a high cost for innovation because it means organizations close themselves from outside inspiration and perspectives. And today, that is exactly <a href=\"http://www.game-changer.net/2015/07/08/bottom-up-innovation-is-the-new-normal/#.V5_dDmU3foo\" target=\"_blank\">how one innovates faster</a>.It is usually <a href=\"http://www.game-changer.net/2016/06/02/solving-the-10-most-common-innovation-challenges/#.V5_XUWU3fop\" target=\"_blank\">outsiders who reimagine industries </a>because they are not anchored in the same beliefs and assumptions as incumbents; that is great <a href=\"http://www.game-changer.net/2013/12/28/for-innovation-dont-ignore-the-zero-gravity-thinker/\" target=\"_blank\">power you can bring into your organization</a>.Solving this challenge:&#xA0;Innovation today must be managed as an open system, with a far greater external focus. Active source outsiders, reward people for looking bringing ideas from the outside, whether through partnerships, collaborations or the simple act of thinking like an outsider.<strong>8. Cheap ideas</strong>Let&#x2019;s be honest, most ideas that are launched by established organizations are pretty dull. More &#x201C;catch up&#x201D; than &#x201C;step change&#x201D;, which is the result of focusing too much on ideas, not on insight.Our world is full of more of the same ideas because, well, ideas are cheap; insights are hard to get.Simply throwing ideas at the wall, or taking what already exists and making it 10% better is not a recipe for game-changing innovation; it is a recipe for stagnation.This isn&#x2019;t the right way to brainstorm ideas, attitude and perspective are what are needed.Solving this challenge:&#xA0;Adopt an <a href=\"http://www.game-changer.net/2010/09/24/insights-first-ideas-second/#.V5_dcGU3foo\" target=\"_blank\">insights first, ideas second mindset</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.game-changer.net/2016/02/25/great-innovation-teams-are-driven-by-customer-insights/#.V5_diGU3foo\" target=\"_blank\">best innovations teams are driven</a> by insights because they understand the perspective an insight provides is the seed of a new groundbreaking idea.<strong>9. Silo Mentality</strong>Today we live and work in an age of knowledge where collaboration is a competitive advantage, so being able to share this knowledge is imperative. Many organizations have yet to get the memo, for they still have a silo mentality where certain departments do not share information with others in the same company. This type of mentality will reduce efficiency in the overall operation, reduce morale, and may contribute to the demise of a productive company culture.Solving this challenge:&#xA0;This is a leadership challenge, it requires leaders to create a unified front to encourage trust, empowerment and collaboration to go from a &#x201C;my department&#x201D; to &#x201C;our organization&#x201D; mentality.<strong>10. No time for play</strong>Businesses have it all wrong when it comes to innovation because they believe it is additive, so simply adding more innovation programs, more hackathons, more this, more that; will work.It won&#x2019;t.Innovation work is messy and though there are many tools available; it doesn&#x2019;t move in a straight line. People need time to play with ideas that don&#x2019;t fit the day to day activities, that means reducing distractions such as unnecessary meetings, bombarding them with emails and overall trivial work.It&#x2019;s also important to note that many employees may be involved in too many projects, which leads to cognitive fatigue and overall burnout; leaving zero energy for playing with new ideas.<a href=\"http://www.game-changer.net/2012/10/08/subtract-to-innovate/#.V5_dvGU3foo\" target=\"_blank\">Innovation is subtractive</a>, which means you have to <a href=\"http://theweek.com/article/index/252827/why-your-organization-sucks-at-innovating\" target=\"_blank\">STOP doing stuff that impedes it</a>. And there are few things any business can stop doing to unleash the powers that drive innovation.Solving this challenge: <a href=\"http://www.game-changer.net/2014/07/10/crap-is-the-real-killer-of-innovation/#.V5_d52U3foo\" target=\"_blank\">Eliminate the CRAP</a>.C &#x2026;.. always need consensus, afraid to make decisions<br>R &#x2026;.. risk aversion<br>A &#x2026;.. analysis paralysis<br>P &#x2026;.. process driven, not results drivenGet rid of the CRAP and you open the door for innovation.&#xA0;Bottom line: Innovation is a cultural challenge, of mindset and execution. For that reason, it&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.game-changer.net/2013/08/19/law-of-innovation-inertia/#.V5_eD2U3foo\" target=\"_blank\">not a copy and paste exercise</a> where you take ideas from an innovative company and implement them in your organization as is; you have to define your own culture and mindset.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

Is there an enduring and valuable legacy or did it all die before it got old?Transformation, optimism, tragedy, and disenchantment. To some degree, all decades are marked by these historic rites of passage; yet, it seems none as vibrantly, violently, and memorably as the 1960&#x2019;s.The 1950&#x2019;s post-war economic boom in the U.S. ignited hope, patriotism, and national confidence from coast to coast. Everything and anything was possible; the shine of capitalism would gild the future like ticker tape while NASA reached for the moon itself.In 1961, the White House welcomed the youngest ever President and John F. Kennedy&#x2019;s broad smile reflected the high hopes and bright dreams of the zeitgeist. America&#x2019;s youth, no longer seen and not heard, carved a contentious cultural divide from their parents to the sound of Elvis, the look of denim, and the art of abstract expressionism. American culture led the world.On November 22, 1963, those dreams were blasted from a rooftop in Texas and adolescent America lost its innocence in shock and paranoia. &#xA0;Yet, just three months later, The Beatles arrived in New York, and upon landing, restored a sense of joy, giddy rapture, and fanaticism. Alongside Dylan, the Fab Four were seen as the liberators of teenage America. The cultural rebellion had begun.By 1965, the young and progressive American collective consciousness was at once raised, altered, and liberated as experimentation with drugs, protest, and sexuality crashed through cultural barriers. In a starkly short time, mop tops were grown out for the serious business of protest and civil rights movements. Student power began to flex its muscles and promote and propagate personal expression through every available cultural channel.&#xA0;The new countercultural language and actions of American youth were echoed and even heightened in other nations, from France to Czechoslovakia.Embodying emerging philosophies shaped around simplicity and essence, new design principles married aesthetics with ergonomics and consideration for the environment. Everywhere, innovations in design and architecture displayed a new rendering of Modernism into a more streamlined contemporary look. Utilizing new materials, an unprecedented cluster of iconic and sleek classic styles defined the decade and pollinated forward thinking and creative design across the globe.But by the turn of the decade, the Utopian dream had imploded.&#xA0;The peace and nature-loving egalitarian vision of society that emerged on the west coast would last a mere four years, before descending into disenchantment and violence. The age of The Rolling Stones&#x2019; Street Fighting Man had arrived with an unnecessary futile war&#xA0;and conservative retaliation to the social unrest, generated by the youth and progressive elements of the middle class. Faith in leadership was fractured. The economy began to stall, and paranoia about communism and corporations emerged, coldly and persistently pursuing the rest of the decade and beyond. Vietnam continued until the disastrous conclusion in 1975, and governmental helplessness and conservative repression appeared to extinguish the burning optimism that opened the &#x2018;60s.So what, if anything, has this colorful, political, and moral maelstrom of a decade left for us? After all, the parallels to today&#x2019;s world have never been more numerous or evident. Were the broken barriers and shattered taboos, once deemed controversial and threatening, mainly aesthetic and idealistic rather than realistic?The HOPE of the Obama election is fading fast, eclipsed on a daily basis by the enormity and number of today&#x2019;s challenges.&#xA0;We currently abide alongside the wake and shadow of terrorism on a previously unimaginable scale, two futile wars, critical environmental crises and the greatest economic disaster since the &#x2018;30s. Lack of bipartisan politics, and corporate greed, have placed not just the nation, but most of the world, on the brink of unprecedented disaster.The optimism of the &#x2018;60s lasted until 1968 before imploding. This time around, we&#x2019;ve managed to get there in half the time.Unlike the &#x2018;60s, there is a paucity of artists, icons, and representatives to set our concerns to poetry and instill hope. Where is our Dylan, our Lennon? Other than the street works of Shepard Fairey and Banksy, the art world seems to look on without comment or censure to incite us, and the globalization of fashion has rendered it generic in form. And of course, we&#x2019;re all teenagers now&#x2014;how can today&#x2019;s youth rebel against a generation of rebels? Where are anger and schism when son, dad, and granddad all go to see Clapton? But maybe the solace of the arts has become impotent and almost irrelevant versus the scale of today&#x2019;s challenges.But does it matter? And do we need them? The age of technology and social networking have enabled millions of individual clamoring voices to be heard, circumventing the need to subscribe to a particular movement or collective. This year, the media of Facebook and Twitter have propagated the fall of four international and long established regimes, with the likelihood of more to follow.Whether it will make a difference remains to be seen, but the Occupy Movement has evolved and started to prickle the authorities. The police are pepper spraying peacefully protesting students in California and arresting media in New York. And like the revolutions in the Arab World, it&#x2019;s again, powered by social media.Maybe it&#x2019;s true. We might not have the singers, artists and banners, and the medium may be different, but when it comes to expression and empowerment the &#x2018;60s have shown us how to do it. And in fact, shown us that we CAN do it&#x2014;that being heard is a basic right.Though we may reflect on the revolutions and tribulations of the &#x2018;60s and wonder where their resonance lies, many of the lessons and changes, that were wrought through the growing pains of the decade, are so woven into the fabric of our awareness that they are taken for granted. For example, all around us there is evidence that aesthetic values coined in the &#x2018;60s have translated very well into future decades.Designs imagined and developed through the &#x2018;60s have outlasted the idiosyncrasies of Postmodernism and its demise, such that not everything from that era is anachronistic. Today, the medium for communication may be radically different, but we only have to look at the iconic products coming from Apple to see that the new way to experience artistic endeavor, community, and solidarity are encased in a direct design homage to the 1960&#x2019;s.Simple, yet elegant in form and function, these principles are still truly relevant today in all their complexity:&#x2022;<strong>&#xA0;</strong>Non-conformity and paths of self-expression are vital, not merely to be tolerated, but embraced and valued.&#x2022; Popular culture, art, music, and design can be both an expression of collective concerns and a call to arms against them.&#x2022; The world in which we live needs to be cherished, nurtured, and valued.&#x2022;&#xA0;Considered and conscientious design will always be relevant in an ever-changing world.&#xA0;<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span><em>Photo: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/sleepishly/3916515218/sizes/o/in/photostream/\" target=\"_blank\">Jessica Diamond</a></em>"

       "content_body":"Once upon a time, like many startups, HubSpot turned its nose up at human resources. We thought, compared to business priorities like product-market fit, it just wasn&#x2019;t that important. We viewed HR as the very bureaucracy we were trying so hard to resist. In time, we changed our minds.<br><br>Over the years, HubSpot has steadily increased its investment in culture. And as I&#x2019;ve watched other companies do the same, I&#x2019;ve started to observe some common milestones on the path to making people a priority.<strong>Milestone #1: Recognize that culture matters</strong><br>The first version of a company&#x2019;s culture emerges organically. It will be some blend of your company&#x2019;s mission, the personality and working style of of your founder(s), and the first 5&#x2013;10 hires. Often, in the early days of a new, growing company, the excitement about the mission you&#x2019;re on and the product you&#x2019;re building will be enough to power a good culture. But that culture has a shelf life.<br><br>In 2012, our CEO, Brian Halligan, attended a CEO support group, and the topic of culture came up. A fellow CEO told him HubSpot should get more thoughtful about culture, so he asked the most thoughtful person he knew to tackle it: his co-founder, Dharmesh.<strong>Milestone #2: Codify what makes you tick</strong><br>Dharmesh took the challenge head-on and became the architect of what would eventually become HubSpot&#x2019;s Culture Code. The document Dharmesh created has garnered more than three million views to-date.<iframe style=\"border: 1px solid #CCC; border-width: 1px; margin-bottom: 5px; max-width: 100%;\" src=\"//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/cTHCJwQlGHBTRS\" width=\"595\" height=\"485\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"> </iframe>Warning here, the better your culture is, the harder it will be to codify. In a crappy company culture, employees will likely ignore your attempts to clarify your values and mission or nod along in bored agreement. In a great company culture, the opposite is likely to happen (it did for us).For us, employees were vocal about feeling like the entire effort was &#x201C;corporatey.&#x201D; In addition, our employees were (and are) fiercely protective of the culture they had helped build at HubSpot. The thought of releasing the &#x201C;secret sauce&#x201D; of that culture to the public elicited some strong responses.<br><br>In spite of this negative feedback, Dharmesh decided to move head with publishing the culture code in 2012. We felt it was important for two reasons:While we didn&#x2019;t wait for consensus to ship the culture code, we did get input. Dharmesh solicited three rounds of company-wide input and asked for specific guidance on a few key concepts from people whose opinion he really valued, then shipped it. He called it &#x201C;code&#x201D; for a reason&#x2013;like the code we ship to customers, he wanted us to regularly refactor the document to match the needs of our customers and our company.<br><br>To this day, Dharmesh personally refactors the Culture Code (often designing the slides himself) on a quarterly basis with input from our employees.<strong>Milestone #3: Market what matters</strong><br>Here is where you&#x2019;ll start to feel the first return on your culture investment. Once you&#x2019;re clear about what makes your culture special, and once you share that with the world, you&#x2019;ll start to attract more and more people who are excited about what you&#x2019;re doing.<br><br>When we launched the Culture Code, we knew it would resonate with employees and prospective employees. We drastically underestimated was how much the Culture Code would resonate with our customers.<br><br>Your prospects have thousands of options for companies to do business with&#x2013;it&#x2019;s your job to give them a compelling reason why they should choose yours. Particularly in the world of software as a service, your customers are buying a long-term relationship with your team, they want to understand what type of business you&#x2019;re building.<br><br><strong>Milestone #4: Scale culture</strong><br>In 2014, HubSpot went public, a milestone for the company, but often a negative milestone for organizational cultures. We had heard time and time again that the year after your IPO is when you should anticipate the highest attrition and expect your culture to go sideways.<br><br>Dharmesh, Brian, and our COO, JD Sherman, wanted to defy these odds&#x2013;and they asked me to lead the charge on this front as the VP of culture. Up to this point, I had worked closely with Dharmesh on the launch of the Culture Code, and spent long hours debating what autonomy means, how we structure unlimited vacation at scale, and how we describe our culture to potential investors on the IPO Roadshow. I figured there was a high chance that I would be unemployed in six months, but I took the role one month after our IPO.<br><br>That was two years ago.<br><br>We made plenty of mistakes during the scale-up stage, but I think there are three things we got right. And for anyone in scale mode&#x2014;whether that&#x2019;s expanding post-IPO or going from 10&#x2013;50 employees&#x2014;these will likely pay off for you as well:<br><br><strong>We doubled-down on what was working.</strong> Transparency was always a core part of our culture, so we decided to double down on it. In addition to providing company-wide access to management team decks and materials, every executive began taking turns writing a summary of our meeting and his or her impressions of it, then circulating these notes to the entire company. As you scale, double-down on the parts of your culture your employees care about most.<br><br><strong>We started to close the gap between what we say and what we do.</strong> We always said we were an environment that welcomed everyone, but for years, our social events centered around after-hours happy hours&#x2013;an activity that excludes parents, non-drinkers, or just health-conscious people who would rather hit the gym than a bar after work. This caused a lot of frustration for employees who saw the gap between what we said mattered and what we did. We&#x2019;ve started to close this gap. Today, we offer more networking events during the workday and also offer wellness coaching and fitness classes on premise.<br><br><strong>Innovating to avoid disruption.</strong>&#xA0;People talk a lot about products getting disrupted and not enough about how culture is the root cause of innovation (or lack of it). Some ways we solved for this as we scaled was by building programs to help front line employees pitch ideas for new products to our senior leadership meetings, launching a Failure Forum to highlight and incentivize trying new things, and bringing in speakers to help us learn from the mistakes others have made as it relates to complacency. The bigger you are, the harder innovation becomes, you need to build your culture for this.<strong>Milestone #5: Measure culture</strong><br>If you&#x2019;re a data-driven company, eventually you&#x2019;re going to want to start measuring your culture efforts.<br><br>On the employee experience side, we conduct a quarterly survey using employee Net Promoter Score to ask employees how likely they are to recommend HubSpot to a friend. We use a consumer marketing technique very intentionally here: if you&#x2019;re not happy enough at work that you would actively recommend joining our team to a friend, then you&#x2019;re not that happy.<br><br>Don&#x2019;t wait for people to leave your organization en masse before you find out what&#x2019;s broken in your organization&#x2014;create a regular, public, and painless opportunity for employees to tell you what&#x2019;s going on in their world, and be radically transparent with the results even when they are terrible. It&#x2019;s hard to read what isn&#x2019;t working at your company, but it&#x2019;s a lot harder to fix when things are horribly broken than when you can proactively address issues before they become toxic.<br><br>On the candidate experience, we monitor every stage of the candidate journey&#x2014;from candidate NPS scores to acceptance rates. Our approach to data within our people operations team is to use full-funnel employee data points as leading indicators rather than wait for lagging ones to emerge.<br><br>One other note: companies love to use internal data as a form of self-congratulations, ignoring platforms like <a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Glassdoor</a> or <a href=\"https://www.inhersight.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">InHerSight</a> because they include data points that are hard to hear about your organization. You can ignore external data and employee review sites for as long as you&#x2019;d like, but you do so at your peril&#x2014;the scores your candidates and employees leave on review sites are seen by thousands of people each year and have a far greater impact on your acceptance rates and brand than you realize.<strong>Milestone #6: Test culture</strong><br>Unlike software code, a company&#x2019;s culture code can&#x2019;t be tested in a testing environment. These tests will appear at random, and likely when you least expect them. But being passing these tests is an important milestone. This is when it becomes clear to everyone whether or not your culture is some random ideals you tacked on a wall, or a true reflection of your company.<br><br>This past year, HubSpot went through one our biggest tests yet. It&#x2019;s no secret that a former employee wrote a book about his negative experience at HubSpot, and the ensuing fallout led to a series of articles with accusations about our culture, our team, and our business.<br><br>During that time, it would have been easy to just send out a brief comment to employees asking them not to talk about it internally or externally, and even better just to ignore it altogether. We decided to do the opposite. We used this opportunity to build trust by over-communicating with employees, taking tough questions in executive Q&amp;As, and even publishing an honest LinkedIn response to the book.<br><br>Your employees are smart and intuitive, and they talk to each other, their significant others, their families, and candidates. Don&#x2019;t let the most interesting conversations happen in whispers. Create meaningful dialogue about what matters and what&#x2019;s broken even when (especially when) it&#x2019;s hard to do so.<strong>Milestone #7: Give people an (actual) seat at the table</strong><br>For all the talk about culture, it&#x2019;s still rare to find someone at the c-level who is representing the voice of employees. In 2015, HubSpot created its first &#x201C;Chief People Officer&#x201D; role, filled by Jim O&#x2019;Neill. (And as of yesterday, I&#x2019;m stepping into that role)<br><br>Investment in people at the highest level of the company has allowed us to achieve some important things like having a global culture team with a presence in each of our six offices, and building out programs dedicated to make diversity and inclusion a priority. Most importantly, it keeps our entire leadership focused on making HR a business priority.<br><br>Today we have a recipe for what works here, but that recipe is changing. Over the next 1&#x2013;2 years, we expect HubSpot to continue to grow globally. Each of these employees will bring not just &#x201C;fit&#x201D;, but also new additions to our culture. What will that mean for HubSpot in 1,2,5 years from now? Who knows. But I&#x2019;m excited about finding the next milestone on our path.<em>Read more from <a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/author/katie-burke#filters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Katie</a>.</em><em>Original post on <a href=\"https://thinkgrowth.org/the-path-to-making-people-a-priority-4fbb1f181b8c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ThinkGrowth</a>.</em><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"<span class=\"s1\">I recently came across an excellent article in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/magazine/what-hollywood-can-teach-us-about-the-future-of-work.html?_r=0\"><span class=\"s2\">The New York Times</span></a> from economist Adam Davidson (co-founder of NPR&#x2019;s Planet Money). In it, he describes his experience working as a technical adviser on the film <em>The Big Short</em> and the unique group dynamics he saw while working on set (this is further expanded on in an interview with Russ Roberts on the podcast&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2015/06/adam_davidson_o_1.html\"><span class=\"s2\">EconTalk</span></a>).</span><span class=\"s1\">What struck me most about the article was the degree to which work in Hollywood is <a href=\"https://gothamculture.com/2014/12/11/emergent-order-creates-thriving-organizations/\"><span class=\"s2\">emergent in nature</span></a>. While studios play an important role in providing financial capital and back office functions, most of the important day-to-day work on set was performed by contracted workers. Everyone from set construction to camera operators to makeup and costume designers&#xA0;were recruited to work specifically on that film. Once the film was complete, they would be released to work on other projects. Some have had experience working with each other on previous films, but for many this was their first major project with that particular team.</span><span class=\"s1\">Davidson also noted that he was surprised by how smoothly everything ran. Despite having a decentralized structure where few people in each team knew each other firsthand (let alone across teams), everyone seemed to know their place in the production, performed their duties, and collaborated with little transition time.</span><span class=\"s1\">While this model of organizing seems best suited to the unique demands of film production, there are several trends that point to this development being more than just an isolated incident. Back in 2002,&#xA0;Richard Florida discussed the growing influence of highly skilled and knowledgeable&#xA0;professionals in his book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Creative-Class-Transforming-Community/dp/1491576766\"><span class=\"s2\"><em>Rise of the Creative Class</em></span></a>. He notes that independence is highly valued among those in the Creative Class and as a result, many seek out alternatives to the 9-5 workplace. Moreover, he suggests that within our lifetime, traditional firms will largely disappear and professionals will congregate around specific projects in their place.</span><span class=\"s1\">In addition,&#xA0;since the mid-2000&#x2019;s, firms have increasingly relied on contractors and consultants to perform <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/192430\"><span class=\"s2\">technical tasks</span></a> and provide <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/business/21577376-world-grows-more-confusing-demand-clever-consultants-booming-brainy\"><span class=\"s2\">subject matter expertise</span></a> not native to their internal employees. Those familiar with consulting work will also understand that it&#x2019;s largely project-based as well. Lastly, although tangential, <a href=\"https://gothamculture.com/2016/06/09/organizational-culture-gig-economy/\"><span class=\"s2\">the rise of the gig economy</span></a> has created a work structure where individuals provide valuable services but are largely independent of the day-to-day operations of the parent company.</span>&#xA0;<span class=\"s1\">More interesting, though, is that Davidson suggests the Hollywood model not only represents the future of work, but also a return to a structure of work that was prevalent prior to the 20th Century. In fact, Davidson argues that the large firms (and the long-term employment contracts associated with them) that dominated the 20th Century were something of an anomaly.</span><span class=\"s1\">If you look at history following the industrial revolution, work was much more contractual than in the last century. Davidson suggests that the necessity to adapt to rapid changes in the current market will lead us back toward a contract-based work model. This new way of working will serve as a middle ground between the traditional corporate model of work and the gig economy of Uber, Upwork, and Airbnb.</span><span class=\"s1\"><strong>SO, WHAT WILL THE FUTURE OF WORK ENTAIL?</strong></span><span class=\"s1\">Davidson highlights four key trends that will be integral to the future of work.</span><span class=\"s1\"><strong>WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR ORGANIZATIONAL DEVELOPMENT?</strong></span><span class=\"s1\">These changes will produce unique challenges to <a href=\"https://gothamculture.com/services/\"><span class=\"s2\">organizational development</span></a>. While organizations will continue to establish a strategic direction and provide the infrastructure and institutional framework to enable work to be done, it will be increasingly difficult for them to utilize a heavy-handed approach to driving change.</span><span class=\"s1\">For instance, it will likely be much easier to hire and fire individuals, but more difficult to control how they work while contracted. Organizations will need to establish much clearer requirements for projects and enhance the quality of metrics to assess their progress, but also rely on the credibility of contracted workers to ensure they are completed on time and on budget. This will become a careful balancing act.</span><span class=\"s1\">When addressing an issue, it will be much more difficult to implement a reorganization or point to a specific department. Instead, it will be necessary for organizations to see projects as an ecosystem and study how people actually align, organize, and interact before changes are made. While this approach is plausible, organizations will experience growing pains as they adapt to this new environment.</span><span class=\"s1\"><strong>HOW DO WE LEAD IN THIS ENVIRONMENT?</strong></span><span class=\"s1\">This model of work also has implications for how we think about leadership and the roles leaders perform in organizations. In his recent book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Evolution-Everything-How-Ideas-Emerge/dp/0062296000\"><span class=\"s2\"><em>The Evolution of Everything</em></span></a>, Matt Ridley argues that we have a fixation on the idea that firms operate like feudal estates, with CEOs and business leaders serving as nobility, giving decrees from on high. When you peel back the layers, you see a very different picture. Many of the successes within modern firms are attributed to the ability of employees to specialize and share their insights with others.</span><span class=\"s1\">This shifts the emphasis from the top-down direction of the leader to the bottom-up processes of leadership (that is, the relationships and interactions between people that enable us to accomplish our shared goals). To the extent that leaders perform a role, it is to facilitate that process. Leaders will likely serve as intermittent contributors rather than permanent fixtures of a project. Their success will be judged primarily on their ability to form relationships, foster open communication, and troubleshoot problems; all qualities necessary to maintaining a healthy leadership process.</span><span class=\"s1\">The nature of work is changing. Organizations must learn to navigate a world where most work will be performed by outside parties focused on specific projects. Success will be based on their ability to create environments that enable people to organize naturally, strengthen collaborative relationships, and ensure individual projects align to achieve broader organizational goals.</span>&#xA0;<span class=\"s1\">Original post&#xA0;<a href=\"https://gothamculture.com/2016/12/22/the-hollywood-model-adapting-future-of-work/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GothamCulture.</a> </span><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"It&#x2019;s difficult to predict the Return On Investment for design. It&#x2019;s often an afterthought or an obligatory step in the business process. Yet design is good for business, and insisting on great design helps to shape an even better business. Giving design the attention it deserves is the first step to improving your chances of a meaningful ROI.Responding to compelling design and a powerful image is an immutable law of human nature. With a careful, thought-through strategy behind it, standout design has the potential to produce healthy fiscal returns, change the way people think about, and respond to, your brand while also enhancing or improving the way they live their lives.<strong>If only common sense wasn&#x2019;t so common</strong>The common sense logic of the everyday executive tells us that design is nothing more than an expense&#x2014;a drain on the budget, an area that companies must begrudgingly fork out cash for because someone said there was a need for a new logo, new packaging, or something else that falls within the scope of visual output. Then, one must endure the tedious endeavour of working with those facially-haired guy and multi-color-haired girl types as they talk about colors, typefaces and look &amp; feel. And pay them to put those damn doodles on to paper for you.A negative attitude towards design is dangerous in today&#x2019;s constantly evolving world. Of course there are the exceptions, but for many people over many years &#x2018;<em>just make it look nice so I can move on to more important things and focus on how to sell my product&#x2019; </em>has been the attitude towards those designery types.Even if you&#x2019;re not a designer you can&#x2019;t help but see that design is an important subject in business today. In so many ways the design of, and around, your brand is a vital part of your product, service and communication. It&#x2019;s central to what people are buying&#xAD;&#xAD;&#xAD;&#x2014;the image, feeling and perception that the design creates. Hopefully you&#x2019;re one of the enlightened few&#x2014;and if you&#x2019;re looking for new perspectives and a healthy dollop of uncommon sense, well here it is:<strong>&#xA0;</strong><strong>Design isn&#x2019;t an expense. It&#x2019;s an investment.</strong>Design is an investment that if done well can deliver an incredibly high yield. Take the yogurt brand <a href=\"http://www.chobani.com/history\">Chobani</a> for example, in nine years they became the <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-01-31/at-chobani-the-turkish-king-of-greek-yogurt#p2\">top Greek yogurt brand</a> in the U.S holding 52% of market share in the category, taking home 12.5% of the overall yogurt market, and <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/onmarketing/2014/01/27/let-design-do-the-talking-for-brands/\">according to the Washington Post, amassed $4.3 billion in revenue for 2013</a>.When the company began, there was no room in the budget for traditional advertising so the founder and CEO, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/hamdi-ulukaya/\">Hamdi Ulukaya</a> realized that the key to gaining attention on supermarket shelves came down to a gripping design. He spent $250,000 (half of his working capital) on cup design, creating a unique, inviting and fatter cup with bold, crisp colors and gorgeously simple elements. &#x201C;People say, &#x2018;It&#x2019;s yogurt, who cares?&#x2019; but there&#x2019;s emotion to it&#x201D; Ulukaya says. &#x201C;You can make this a moment, the opening of it, the eating of it, the experience. I spent so much time on every single detail&#x201D;.Number one in under a decade, that&#x2019;s an incredible feat and in many ways, solely a result of great design. Forbes estimates Ulukaya&#x2019;s personal net worth at $1.5 billion&#x2014;not a bad return on a $250,000 investment in design.<strong>Design is more than a logo or product packaging </strong>Design isn&#x2019;t an airy-fairy-make-it-look-pretty craft. I&#x2019;m talking about the work of the pragmatic designers&#x2014;they are one of the best people to have in your corner. The professionals who are as concerned about the impact and success of your business as you are, and who will passionately utilize their skills towards bettering results.Pragmatic designers are exceptionally hard working and have a meticulously thought-out approach to how consumers will see your brand. Still not sure design is a worthy investment? Well, <a href=\"http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2013/06/the-creator-of-the-nike-swoosh-logo-was-originally-paid-only-35-for-the-design/\">Nike paid just $35 in 1975</a> for their swoosh logo and look at its traction&#x2014;it&#x2019;s so powerful that anytime you see or hear the word &#x2018;swoosh&#x2019; you can&#x2019;t help but envision that distinctively curvaceous tick. Go on, try! Convince someone to say <em>swoosh</em> to you or ask your computer to read the term in that mechanical Stephen Hawkins voice, then close your eyes&#x2026; and you&#x2019;ll see that I&#x2019;m right. You can actually see it and have memories flood in that are associated with it.<strong>Design is an investment</strong>When you start thinking about design as an investment you&#x2019;ll see that it has rewards, both in the short and long-term. Great design can spike sales for a couple of months and keep consumers coming back for generations to come. Consider Coca Cola&#x2014;my grandparents drank it, I drink it and I&#x2019;m pretty sure my great-grandkids will too. Sure, the design may have changed subtly over time but the heart of the brand hasn&#x2019;t and that&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s the most recognized brand in the world.Design has the power to affect your company&#x2019;s bottom line and, just as importantly, your consumer&#x2019;s awareness, trust and perception of your brand&#x2014;which will lead to even more bottom line growth in the future.Investing in great design can have far reaching benefits for you and your consumer. Take a national flag as an example. As a physical product, a flag is nothing more than an ordinary piece of cloth with a simple design. But it is hardly ever sold as just a product because it&#x2019;s designed as a symbol&#x2014;an identity for all who fly it, salute to it and give their lives for it. If you&#x2019;re lucky enough, your brand can have as much depth of meaning as a nation&#x2019;s flag. Apple&#x2019;s cult-like brand status and following has accomplished this same feat. If people are getting your logo tattooed on themselves, you must be doing something right.You don&#x2019;t have to be a designer to realize the importance of great design. We are all inherently drawn to it. People can&#x2019;t help but be attracted to something that is beautiful, intelligent and commands respect&#x2014;those happen to be the three prerequisites for a news anchor. Coincidence? I think not.What price can you put on your consumers&#x2019; desire and fanaticism for your brand? It must be more than what a pragmatic designer charges.So my advice when flying your own flag is to make sure that it&#x2019;s been designed in such a way that people will want to fly it for themselves.That&#x2019;s a return on your investment. That&#x2019;s exponential growth. And that&#x2019;s why I believe that great design is worth every penny.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

But it is&#x2026; because it demands us to be both self-aware and willing to be compassionate.Active listening is all bright-eyed, big smile and nodding approval kind of a listening. Deeper listening is reading between the lines and &#x201C;feeling&#x201D; things rather than just hearing the words. Compassionate listening is, really, getting ready to say &#x201C;Oh dear, I know exactly what you are going through&#x2026;&#x201D;&#x201C;Real listening is a willingness to let the other person change you.&#x201D; -Alan Alda, Never Have Your Dog Stuffed: And Other Things I&#x2019;ve LearnedSay it to yourself a few times.

You need to forego everything else that you have been planning to bring to the table.If we are only interacting to have it our way or to keep things the same, then we are either on offense or defense. We are defending or attacking a position. We are only trying to forward our position. We are not listening.Listening takes softness, openness, a willingness to be moved or changed by the other person.

       "content_body":"It was nearly three years ago when we first sat down in a Purdue campus coffee shop to talk about the ideas that would later come to comprise our book, <em>Be More</em>.Sitting at a wobbly table together with only about 10 words, a few crude drawings scratched out on a couple pieces of paper, mutual trust, and knowledge that we would always push one another&#x2014;that between us, we&#x2019;d get this thing done.Looking back, we laugh a bit at how na&#xEF;ve we were. How little we knew about writing a book was exceeded only by how little we knew about publishing one. But in less than two years&#x2019; time, we had done both.Knowing that our subject matter was important, needed and timely became a great motivator. Gallup reported recently that <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/194204/millennials-job-hoppers-not.aspx?g_source=EMPLOYEE_ENGAGEMENT&amp;g_medium=topic&amp;g_campaign=tiles\" target=\"_blank\">71% of millennial employees aren&#x2019;t engaged at work</a>. And that number isn&#x2019;t solely a reflection of a particular trend among that age group either. Gallup&#x2019;s multi-year report <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/services/178514/state-american-workplace.aspx?g_source=EMPLOYEE_ENGAGEMENT&amp;g_medium=topic&amp;g_campaign=tiles\" target=\"_blank\"><em>State of the American Workplace</em></a> uncovered similar findings among all workers.<em>Be More </em>also grew from Todd&#x2019;s recognition of (and frustration with) intelligent, successful and highly competent people&#x2019;s inability to answer the question, What do you want to be when you grow up? We know instinctively that the number of people who want more out of life greatly exceeds those who are able to articulate what that means.&#xA0;Together, those two realities&#x2014;lots of people who want something more from life and lots of people who weren&#x2019;t meaningfully engaged in their current jobs&#x2014;defined our purpose. We set out to create a practical, useable and accessible guide to help people learn to say what getting more out of life means in their lives&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s what we did. Our guide aims to unlock the untapped potential of people who will propel economic growth, ingenuity, prosperity and even happiness.At the end of the day, we didn&#x2019;t make <em>Be More</em> because of an acute, pressing need that suddenly emerged in the world. The ideas that it&#x2019;s built on were part of Todd&#x2019;s thinking and informed by conversations he had with coworkers from years before we even met, not because the story had magically become more compelling.We created <em>Be More</em> because we know that it may not be the smartest or the most talented among us whose achievements are the most impressive. In fact, we contend that it may very well be those who learn early to answer the question, What do you want to be when you grow up? Helping people learn to find their unique answer to that universal question is deeply meaningful.Our book began without an agent or a publisher. After completing the first draft, it seemed that the truest thing to do was to listen to the lessons from the book&#x2014;to control its evolution, to put this story into the world ourselves. When you set a goal and find a special intersection of skills, values and passion, there is no part of &#x201C;it&#x2019;s hard&#x201D; that merits giving up. That&#x2019;s when it&#x2019;s time to dig deeper and push harder.Once you decide what you want to accomplish in your life and what mission you want to achieve, it&#x2019;s time to put action behind those thoughts, ideas and words&#x2014;it&#x2019;s time to act. But first, you have to find the resolve that will power those actions. We became authors and publishers in exactly the way that things happen every day, with the first step that matters most of all.We just decided to.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"The title of this post may lead you to believe that I&#x2019;m going to talk to you about how I teach all day, come home, and grade papers and tests all night. It might lead you to believe that I&#x2019;m going to discuss education policy and reform, and why I feel my students are getting a bad deal. You may be preparing yourself to skim through a post about how, even with the state American education is in right now, I wouldn&#x2019;t hesitate to encourage students to become teachers.This is not that post.A few years ago, it was my responsibility to teach 186 ninth grade students. And yes, I got very little done at school everyday. Yes, I took work home with me every night and did work on the weekends. Yes, I also worked a part-time job to afford rent. Yes, I struggled to complete grad school at the same time. Yes, I spent my summers in professional development classes, and <strong><em>yes</em></strong>, I get very, <strong><em>very</em></strong> annoyed when people reduce a teacher&#x2019;s job so far down as to say they&#x2019;ve &#x201C;got it so easy&#x201D; getting all that time off.I welcomed such people into my classroom on numerous occasions so they could see exactly how easy it is to manage 186 ninth graders. Not one person took me up on my offer.The truth is that, while I have very strong feelings about all of that, and while I&#x2019;d spent my entire life since the age of three preparing to become a teacher, I couldn&#x2019;t make it. I&#x2019;m a really hard worker. I&#x2019;m very driven.And I still couldn&#x2019;t make it.It&#x2019;s given me so much more respect for teachers than I ever had before (which was already a lot).We all knew a teacher who ran in at the last minute during homeroom, was out the door with the final bell, and never made much of an effort to get to know the studetns in between. Even the following year, we&#x2019;d get the feeling he or she had forgotten our names.During my short four years as a teacher, I was fortunate enough to encounter some truly remarkable students&#x2014;in the academic sense, yes, but also as people.What I discovered early on was this: fourteen-year olds are still perceptive. They may not always act like it, but they want to be treated as equals. It&#x2019;s obviously much easier to do this with some than with others&#x2014;exactly how it is with many adults, too.Sure, I wanted to share my love of literature with my students, but I also wanted to know who they were. I didn&#x2019;t want to be that teacher who didn&#x2019;t know my students as people. I wanted to invest in them. To fulfill my passion, I coached softball and served as the advisor to a community service club, both of which afforded me ample time to &#x201C;hang out&#x201D; and learn who my students were outside the classroom. It allowed them to get to know me as well, and in the process, build their trust in me.Suddenly I found myself with students in my classroom during my planning periods because they wanted to talk to me about their lives. They wanted to ask for my advice when choosing classes. They needed help with homework or had a question about the MLA Style Guide. Former students would come back and ask me questions about the college experience as they prepared to apply to universities.When I announced that I wouldn&#x2019;t be returning to my job and would be moving back to my hometown in another state, the students with whom I&#x2019;d become the closest surrounded me on the last day of school, giving me hugs, helping me pack up my classroom, making going-away &#x201C;care packages&#x201D; for me, and writing me truly thoughtful thank you notes.Teachers are often criticized for their use of social media because they&#x2019;re often scrutinized to a higher degree than most users. I see it as a good way to extend your positive influence if you&#x2019;re smart about it. Through email and Facebook, I was able to keep in touch with my students. As I kept an eye on their college application progress, many of them reached out to me for recommendation letters. From two states away, I was happy to oblige.And when I turned up at their high school graduation ceremonies, they gave me big hugs and told me how much it meant to them for me to be there.When they got to college, some of them reached out to me to ask how to deal with homesickness and separation anxiety. They wanted to know how to find financial aid and what was the best way to go about distance learning. They contacted me when they got in trouble&#x2014; not because they wanted me to help them out of it or justify their actions, but because they wanted a trusted adult to listen to the mistakes they made without judging or punishing them.They told me about new friends, boyfriends and girlfriends, and how they felt closer to their college friends now than their high school friends. This year, many of my former students are college seniors and juniors. Some have graduated already and are out in the &#x201C;real world.&#x201D;And yet, there are still a handful of former students who will call me up or send me a message on Facebook regularly because they still want my help. They have questions or want to talk about applying for jobs, finding apartments, relocating, or dealing with the post-college blues.I cannot even express to you how happy it makes me to know them and to be able to continue to help them. I see the amazing things some of them are doing, like playing for nationally-known college sports teams, getting national recognition for leadership skills in college, starting a modeling career&#x2014;and I&#x2019;m so proud of them and to know them.My former students are totally inspiring to me. It&#x2019;s also reassuring to know that, although my original career track didn&#x2019;t work out for me, I still made a difference. I may have moved away and switched careers, but I never stopped caring about my students. It&#x2019;s been nearly four years since my final year of teaching ended and still, my job is never done. And I wouldn&#x2019;t have it any other way.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"I have had the privilege to run a consulting company for a few years now. A couple of summers ago one of our interns, who had recently graduated from college, was being considered for a full-time position. She had done a great job as an intern, was energetic, curious, thoughtful, hard working and, most importantly, passionate about what we do. Her skill set wasn&#x2019;t perfect for the role, but we felt she could learn those skills and be a concrete contributor. We offered her the job.Our HR lead, the soon-to-be-hired intern and myself met. What happened next is something I will never forget. As I told her that we wanted her to come on as a full-time employee, she shrieked in excitement, jumped up to give me a long hug and started to cry. She then looked at me and told me how truly grateful she was for the opportunity.<strong>GRATITUDE IS INFECTIOUS<br></strong>I thanked our intern for her excitement and reminded her that we didn&#x2019;t give her anything she did not deserve. Followed by a confirmation that her reaction meant she was going to take the position. She yelled &#x201C;YES!&#x201D; and ran out of the room to call her parents with the good news.I have had plenty of opportunities over the course of my career to make job offers, but her reaction moved me more than any other. It wasn&#x2019;t just her infectious excitement, but above all it was her expression of gratitude. It created uncommon energy within her&#x2014;but also within me. Her grateful nature gave me goose bumps. It humbled me. It compelled me to acknowledge my gratitude for the business we are a part of and what we get to do every day. It also made me really think about, and appreciate, the power of authentic gratefulness and also how little of it we actually have in business.<strong>GRATITUDE EQUALIZES LEADERSHIP<br></strong>Gratefulness and its effects are beginning to be studied more and the results are pretty startling. Just recently the <a href=\"http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-10/uosc-hsm101915.php\">Brain and Creativity Institute at USC</a> did a study to identify how the human brain experiences gratitude&#x2014;by using testimonials from Holocaust survivors. The findings proved that feelings of gratitude activate areas responsible for moral cognition, reward, fairness, subjective value judgments and economic decision-making.Gratitude not only makes you feel good, but science shows it feeds into the type of skills today&#x2019;s leaders need in order to be successful in very agile and fast changing environments.I also like to think of gratitude as &#x201C;the great equalizer&#x201D;.As leaders we often get preferential treatment, have people working to make sure our schedules and days flow smoothly and have a support system ready to assist when a need arises. For those of us who travel, it&#x2019;s a bit like getting upgraded to first class all the time. You get to board early, have ample space to store your luggage, enjoy a better seat and receive better food. You sort of forget what it&#x2019;s like in the middle seat in coach &#x2026; or at least you don&#x2019;t want to think about what it feels like. Before you know it, you think you are entitled to be in the front and get cocooned from the reality of what it&#x2019;s like for most. Over time, those first class experiences can make us less empathetic and less sensitive to the world around us.Gratefulness&#x2014;like our intern displayed&#x2014;creates humility, which if embraced, is a powerful way for leaders to stay connected and true to themselves.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

Their programs take leaders on an immersive journey and drill deep into their desire to start something new. The result is a global grassroots movement of likeminded people who believe in their ethos.<strong>The power of peoples&#x2019; stories<br></strong>Laurence is incredibly inspiring, as are the people he has the opportunity to surround himself with. He embraces each story he hears, incorporating them into learning lessons he applies to life and business.<em>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s the people we meet every day that are doing great work that inspire me&#x2014;and a lot of them are under the radar, quietly doing their thing. For example, Tim Holtam (who in September will be speaking at their Happy Startup Summercamp) [is] the driving force behind a seemingly run-of-the-mill table tennis club that&#x2019;s changing lives in a profound way as a sanctuary for refugees, cancer sufferers and disadvantaged local youth.&#x201D;</em><strong>Uncommon Sense defined<br></strong>Laurence defines Uncommon Sense as doing things differently and challenging convention&#x2014;being true to what you believe in. He pointed out that this principle is often <strong><em>hard</em></strong> in business because of trends, conventions and norms, but he&#x2019;s a firm believer that if things are going one way, go the opposite. Be ahead of the curve.He&#x2019;s chock-full of Uncommon Sense, so we asked him to delve into the three Uncommon Sense principles he lives by personally and professionally.1) <strong>Make it fun.</strong> Inject fun into everything you do. If it&#x2019;s not fun, don&#x2019;t do it. Fun can be challenging but can create balance along the startup journey.2) <strong>Lose the shoulds</strong>. Do what feels right, not what others think you should do. <em>&#x201C;When we do what feels right, it is right.&#x201D; </em>&#xA0;3) <strong>Less is better.</strong> Ask yourself, &#x201C;<em>How can I do less work, but better?&#x201D;</em> Be really careful not to<a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/how-to-avoid-the-busy-trap\"> fall into the busy trap</a>. Balance your 8-10 hour day with a long mountain hike. Make impact. Be in tune.We encourage you to adopt these principles into your daily routine. Adopting a new mindset can develop fundamental skills that can help you to be a better person and perhaps, it may even help you discover things about yourself that you never would have noticed before. These new discoveries open the mind and lead to great conversations and fresh new ideas.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span><em>Photo: <a href=\"http://www.thehappystartupschool.com \" target=\"_blank\">Happy Startup School</a></em>"

       "content_body":"In December, I stood up in front of our 2000 person company and talked about fertility. I could lie and say it all went perfectly, but it didn&#x2019;t. I stumbled over a few points. I turned a mildly embarrassing shade of pink. And I confessed that years of Catholic school left me woefully unprepared for this moment in my career.So trust me when I say that talking about fertility at work takes some getting used to.<br>It&#x2019;s awkward. It feels like a throwback to 7th grade sex education for managers and employees alike. It comes with wanting to do right by single parents, adoptive parents, and LGBTQ colleagues, so you want to make the terminology and approach as inclusive as possible. And then there is the uncertainty about legal, social, and geopolitical norms. Fertility is a tough topic, and so most leaders say nothing at all.But I didn&#x2019;t force myself to awkwardly stumble through this topic just for fun. I did this because I believe that fertility is quickly becoming one of the biggest differentiators in corporate benefits and a topic near and dear to the hearts of candidates and employees alike.<strong>Why leaders should be talking about family, fertility, and flexibility</strong>Studies show <a href=\"https://www.mhtf.org/2017/01/18/the-burden-of-infertility-global-prevalence-and-womens-voices-from-around-the-world/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">50 million people worldwide</a> experience infertility and 6 out of 10 couples say they keep infertility challenges away from even their family and friends. Similarly, a whopping <a href=\"https://www.saywerk.com/for-employers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">two thirds of the American workforce</a> wants more flexibility and yet there&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/02/the-hidden-cost-of-a-flexible-job/385170/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a stigma</a> attached to both requesting and taking advantage of flexible work arrangements.The data for both flexibility and fertility sends a clear message: there&#x2019;s a huge percentage of people globally who want to grow their families and are struggling to do so. And when they are successful in growing their families, they&#x2019;re struggling to balance career and family in a way that works for them.Topics around family, flexibility, and fertility are top of mind to many of our employees. And as leaders, it&#x2019;s time to get over ourselves and start the conversation.Our director of recruiting recently shared her family&#x2019;s personal story about struggling with infertility, and was amazed by the number of employees, candidates, customers, and partners (of all genders and backgrounds) who reached out with their support, personal experiences, and ideas to help us improve what we offer and how we support employees with fertility.<em>Talking about family, flexibility, and fertility takes some getting used to, but it&#x2019;s important enough to make it worth powering through the discomfort. Why? Two words: Recruiting &amp; Retention.</em>A recent study by <a href=\"http://www.frac.tl/employee-benefits-study/\">Fractl</a> found that on the list of benefits that matter significantly to employees, flexibility represents four of the five top consideration factors, and top notch medical care and paid parental leave rank highly on what employees care most about.Leading your recruiting &amp; retention efforts by talking about how your company supports families is a big opportunity for companies to get an edge on attracting and retaining the best talent.And the best talent isn&#x2019;t just ambitious college grads from Ivy League schools. Finding the best talent means a willingness and commitment identifying and developing great leaders beyond campus job fairs and inbound applications:Infusing your workplace with flexibility for everyone can help close the gender gap but the potential impact extends beyond gender. If you care about building a talented workforce that is diverse, inclusive, and successful then benefits that target family, flexibility, and fertility should be a key part of your strategy.<strong>Starting the conversation</strong>My first (and awkward) foray into talking to our company about fertility was announcing that HubSpot is expanding its parental leave and rolling out benefits to help cover the costs of egg freezing. But even if your company can&#x2019;t offer these types of benefits, leaders should still be having this conversation.You&#x2019;ll say some things wrong.<br>You might even do a little blushing.<br>But my colleagues responded with kindness&#x2026;yours will too.<em>Read more from&#xA0;<a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/author/katie-burke#filters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Katie</a>.</em><em>Original post on <a href=\"https://thinkgrowth.org/why-leaders-should-start-talking-about-fertility-and-flexibility-44fd1fb90484\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ThinkGrowth</a>.</em><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "date":"April 20, 2014",
       "principle":"BE THE BRAND",
       "content_body":"Over the last couple of years it has become fashionable to say, &#x201C;You don&#x2019;t own your brand&#x2014;the people do.&#x201D; Social media has apparently given the power to consumers, and marketers are just along for the ride. I think this is an accurate statement&#x2014;if you manage a brand that doesn&#x2019;t actually stand for something.And the truth is that most brands <em>don&#x2019;t </em>stand for something. Oh, sure, they parrot some mumbo jumbo about providing best-in-class this or leading-edge that, or they talk about shareholder value. It&#x2019;s usually in the form of some Vision or Mission Statement&#x2014;the type of thing that&#x2019;s been mercilessly roasted in Dilbert cartoons. <a href=\"http://www.umairhaque.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Umair Haque&#x2019;s</a> <a href=\"http://hbr.org/product/betterness-economics-for-humans/an/11135-PDF-ENG\"><em>Betterness</em></a> provides a proper analysis of how culture and modern business thinking has left those antiquated standards behind.But some brands do, in fact, get it. They understand why they exist, what their purpose is and what value they provide to the world. And we all know which brands these are because <em>they are the ones that turn up time after time in case studies and are mentioned at every conference.</em>Nobody ever suggests that &#x201C;the people&#x201D; own Apple. Or Nike, Chipotle, Netflix, Starbucks or Warby Parker. Why? Because these brands have taken the time to dig deep and truly understand the fundamental question of why they exist. They asked themselves hard questions, they&#x2019;ve made sacrifices, and they&#x2019;ve committed to staying true to their core values. That&#x2019;s not easy&#x2014;if it was, every brand would do it.Of course the next step that takes an organization from being a company&#x2014;a legal entity and a P&amp;L spreadsheet&#x2014;to being a brand, is marketing. These companies have become powerful brands because they are able to articulate their fundamental &#x201C;why&#x201D; in a compelling way. For a fantastic assessment of this, I encourage you to watch this powerful <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action.html\" target=\"_blank\">TEDxPugetSound video</a> featuring Simon Sinek&#x2014;a must-see for all brand marketers. Here, he explains his concept of the Golden Circle, and how companies and organizations focus on the &#x201C;what&#x201D; and &#x201C;how&#x201D; of the business but not the &#x201C;why.&#x201D; You can distill the idea into one simple sentence:<strong>&#x201C;People don&#x2019;t buy what you do, they buy why you do it.&#x201D;</strong>Increasingly people want to have a better understanding of the &#x201C;why&#x201D; behind the brands they use. At the same time, marketers are striving to form relationships with people, yet they are unable to give a compelling reason why people should do so. Very few people want to have a relationship with a place that makes burritos. But plenty of people care about where a brand sources its ingredients, how its meat is processed and the connection the brand has with farmers. That&#x2019;s why Chipotle gets more than 8 million people to <a href=\"http://youtu.be/aMfSGt6rHos\" target=\"_blank\">watch a video</a> that addresses those issues and 12 million to <a href=\"http://youtu.be/lUtnas5ScSE\" target=\"_blank\">watch the follow-up</a> (great songs don&#x2019;t hurt either).Do people own your brand? They do if you haven&#x2019;t put the time and effort into owning it yourself. If every employee of your company doesn&#x2019;t know your &#x201C;why,&#x201D; it&#x2019;s time to rethink your marketing strategy, and as the Chipotle video and Coldplay song suggest, go <em>Back to the Start.</em><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "principle":"ACT WITH PURPOSE",
       "content_body":"A common misconception about design is that it just looks really good. What many people don&#x2019;t realize is that any given design has likely been thought through and agonized over down to the very last little detail. Brilliant design is always driven by a clearly defined purpose, and the outcome is where purpose and functionality meet stunning visuals. The process of combining the two takes an enormous amount of time, thought and effort.&#xA0;We recently had a conversation with the in-house product team at <a href=\"https://modernize.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Modernize</a>&#x2014;an online service that offers homeowners expert guidance and decision-making tools to take on home improvement projects with confidence. We learned about their straightforward online approach to helping people create memorable home experiences. The Modernize team believe that to build the most positive experience, innovation and understanding your customer are key.&#xA0;Here&#x2019;s what the team had to say:<strong>Q: How do you balance brilliant design and function?</strong>A: It&apos;s not necessarily about striking a balance. It&apos;s a path that always begins with nailing down usability and functionality, then applying aesthetic values that enhance them. We lead with a clear purpose and follow with creative design. When you&apos;ve made a good user-friendly design, it&apos;s usually because you let aesthetics enhance the usability that you created at the beginning. We prioritize functionality because we want to make sure our design serves a purpose beyond its aesthetic value.A good example lies in our homepage design. We connect homeowners with trusted home remodeling pros who specialize in four main areas: solar energy, windows, heating &amp; air systems, and roofing. So our homepage not only provides visitors with these clean navigation options, but employs different geometric graphics that double as logos for each of our core trades. Our creative aesthetic helps point the user toward a goal rather than distract from it.<strong>Q: What are the most important aspects of design for a positive user experience?</strong>A: At Modernize, spacing and readability are what we tend to strive for first because we know that in any given web experience, the user either wants information or to get something done, all in the fastest way possible. So we create our design based on what we know is our customers&#x2019; purpose for visiting our site. Maybe they aren&#x2019;t even sure what they want and we need to show them&#x2014;either way, the design should bring the user what they need with little to no friction. Friction means not being able to find what you&apos;re looking for or not getting what you want. We utilize whitespace and always make paths and content as clear as possible so that our experience design serves the needs of our customers.<strong>Q: How do you decide on the ideal user to focus on? How does this decision affect your overall design choices?</strong>A: We have identified numerous personas through user research. For any given design, we pick one or two of these personas at which to aim our design. The persona we choose gives us a clearly defined sense of the purpose which our design must serve. For example, if the persona is an older gentleman, we wouldn&apos;t design a Pinterest-like experience where you bookmark visuals and curate content because that&#x2019;s probably not what he&#x2019;s looking for. Instead, we prioritize hierarchy, assuming he&#x2019;s on a quest for specific information.<strong>Q: How do you use innovation in your user experience?</strong>A: I&#x2019;d say the biggest thing that blocks innovation is assuming that something can&apos;t be done. If a member of our team assumes that our creative technologist can&apos;t code this crazy interaction they have in mind, or that the business can&apos;t support this particular experience, we&#x2019;re potentially missing out on something amazing. So we always try to resist assuming &#x201C;it can&#x2019;t be done&#x201D;.<strong>Uncommon Sense Takeaways:</strong><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

And, self-proclaimed strategists are often aloof, elite and too removed from the reality of closing sales and making shit actually happen. Too few marketing strategists have actually made anything, sold anything or been hands-on responsible for the execution of their plans.The cock is never on the block.&#xA0;And, this is the reason they confuse <em>planning</em> with <em>doing&#x2014;</em>which, in turn, is why they drive creatives and clients crazy, but that&#x2019;s another story. I&#x2019;ve recently figured out a solution for ensuring that planners and strategists never confuse thinking with doing.&#xA0;First, hire strategists who have owned a business. Second, hire ex-salespeople.&#xA0;Failing that&#x2014;and this is the crux of the solution because there are rarely enough ex-salespeople and ex-business owners available&#x2014;only hire strategists who lift weights or play competitive individual sports,&#xA0;ideally combat sports.Why? Because, to quote Henry Rollins, &#x201C;<a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/trunk/1748/henry-rollins-iron-and-soul/\">the iron never lies to you</a>&#x201D;. You either pick it up or you don&#x2019;t.&#xA0;You achieve your goal or you don&#x2019;t.&#xA0;Strategizing and thinking will not get the bar off the ground.&#xA0;The task is clearly in the doing.<strong>The same concept applies to competitive individual sports.

I think the more I train and the more I meet people who are in Jiu Jitsu and train on a regular basis, they&#x2019;re healthier people. Their egos are healthier. Especially men. They&#x2019;re easier to talk to. They&#x2019;re easier to hang out with because they&#x2019;re facing reality on a regular basis. Something that my Tae Kwon Do teacher told me when I was a little kid that I never forgot was that martial arts are a vehicle for developing your human potential. And nothing in my life has ever put me in face with reality better than Jiu Jitsu.In life, we can all distort our perception of things in order to make ourselves more comfortable, in order to make ourselves accept where we are. And there&#x2019;s a lot of people&#xA0;out there who are&#xA0;running around in life full of shit.<strong>You can&#x2019;t be full of shit when you do Jiu Jitsu.</strong>When you do Jiu Jitsu, its impossible to be full of shit because reality comes at you in the purest form possible: A life or&#xA0;death&#xA0;struggle.&#x201D;&#xA0;<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span><em>Photo: <a target=\"_blank\">Why Strategists Should Lift Weights to Learn About Making Shit Happen</a></em>"

And though these are great ways to recognize the day, this year we&#x2019;re going to celebrate the uncommon found on Saint Patrick&#x2019;s Day.Saint Patrick&apos;s Day, or the Feast of Saint Patrick (Irish: L&#xE1; Fh&#xE9;ile P&#xE1;draig, The Day of the Festival of Patrick), is a cultural and Christian religious celebration occurring annually on March 17<sup>th&#x2014;</sup>the death date of the most commonly recognized patron saint of Ireland, Saint Patrick (c. AD 385&#x2013;461).But wait, Saint Patrick wasn&#x2019;t even Irish. He was born in Britain. And, after escaping slavery by Irish marauders when he was 16 years old he returned to England to become ordained as a priest and then returned to Ireland to convert <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/03/110316-saint-patricks-day-2011-march-17-facts-ireland-irish-nation/\">Irish Celtic pagans to Christianity</a>.The original color associated with St. Patrick is blue, not green as commonly believed. There&#x2019;s a color named St. Patrick&#x2019;s Blue, which originated from the country&#x2019;s original flag. The use of <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1972553_1972551_1972489,00.html\">green on St. Patrick&apos;s Day</a> began during the 1798 Irish Rebellion&#x2014;some accredit its meaning to the greenness of the countryside while others say it&#x2019;s the clover, the country&#x2019;s symbol of nationalism.<a href=\"http://www.history.com/topics/st-patricks-day/history-of-st-patricks-day/videos/green?m=528e394da93ae&amp;s=undefined&amp;f=1&amp;free=false\">Here&#x2019;s a short video</a> that explains the history of the Saint Patrick&#x2019;s Day color.There is a solid reason that alcohol has long been a tradition during this holiday. Since Saint Patrick&#x2019;s Day began as a feast held in honor of Saint Patrick, the Christian religion has allowed believers to put aside their Lenten restrictions and consume as much alcohol as they&#x2019;d like on this day.Ironically from 1903 to 1969, <a href=\"http://www.catholic.org/news/saints/story.php?id=45045\">Irish law</a> declared Saint Patrick&apos;s Day a religious observance for the entire country, meaning that all pubs were shut down for the day. The law was overturned in 1970, when the day was reclassified as a national holiday allowing the taps to flow freely once again.One beer on tap everywhere on March 17<sup>th</sup> is the famous Irish stout, Guinness. On any given day 5.5 million pints are consumed around the world. Yet on Saint Patrick&apos;s Day, that number rises to 13 million pints says Beth Davies Ryan, Global Corporate Relations Director of Guinness.

       "content_body":"Although Matt Clifford and the Barnana team have successfully branded bananas&#x2014;yes, the fruit you can buy for $0.40&#x2014;the company started off by learning a hard lesson. &#x201C;<em>In 2012, my friends and I had this idea to start a banana company. Now, I know what you&#x2019;re thinking: that is a bad idea</em>,&#x201D; says the co-founder in an interview with Wisdom Capture.When Matt (COO) and fellow co-founders Caue Suplicy (CEO) and Nik Ingersoll (CMO) learned that 75 billion bananas are wasted each year, &#x201C;<em>The default was to assume that this is already being solved. There&#x2019;s a lot of big players in the produce space that are surely tackling this issue.</em>&#x201D; The waste comes from bananas deemed &#x201C;imperfect&#x201D; for supermarket sale.Although one man&#x2019;s trash would become another man&#x2019;s multi-million-dollar business, &#x201C;<em>We originally wrote the idea off with little research and just assumed that a problem so large was already being addressed.</em>&#x201D; It wasn&#x2019;t until a few months, and much research, later that the friends realized they had a significant opportunity in their hands. No major supplier was upcycling the unused bananas. Fast-forward to the company now, and <a href=\"https://barnana.com/\">Barnana</a> has grown to 20 employees, millions in revenue, and the largest upcycler of organic products in the world.&#x201C;<em>That&#x2019;s what really surprised us and changed the way we see ideas and also opportunities. We just assumed&#x2014;and wrongly assumed&#x2014;that a big idea is already being tackled.

In comparison, it&#x2019;s often unclear in businesses, what values a company operates with. In the military certain protocols exist such as respect for rank regardless of the military branch, following orders, clearly communicating, and giving only one&#x2019;s absolute best. But corporate cultures vary&#x2014;from top down hierarchies, to vague or flat leadership.Military culture is traditional, historically informed and fixed, whereas corporate cultures differ based on the leadership or other variables that oftentimes create challenges for employees at every level. Military personnel have a clearly structured and transparent path to promotion, while in the world of business there&#x2019;s often no defined career progression, and the necessity for employees to manage their careers.It&#x2019;s clear that above all else, the Navy SEAL&#x2019;s functional and effective teamwork is among one of its top strengths. The following SEAL insights could, and should, be applied to working teams in business.<strong><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/tomsaint/2704340171/sizes/m/in/photostream/\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4796\" title=\"NavySeals_2\" src=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/NavySeals_2.jpg\" alt width=\"395\" height=\"282\"></a></strong><strong>1. A Navy SEAL does not discriminate</strong><br> Regardless of shape, size, beliefs or culture, the biggest personal trait demanded of a SEAL is demeanor. A Navy SEAL does not display a superior attitude or arrogance, but rather a&#xA0;confidence in his physical and mental abilities for the good of the team.<strong>2. Every person counts</strong><br> Settling for mediocrity is the death of an organization. Every SEAL knows with 100% confidence that the person behind him will be able to save his life. Corporate leaders need to be able to&#xA0;say the same about their management teams. Employee&#x2019;s livelihoods depend on it.<strong>3. SEALS train</strong><br> When SEALs are not on combat deployment, they spend the vast majority of their time in training. In contrast, executives spend the majority of their time executing. The&#xA0;importance of training for new employees, or even a veteran team, is vital to the success of the business. Navy SEALs spend thousands of hours honing their skills, and so should employees in a profession.<strong>4. Everyone is expendable</strong><br> All SEALs are trained in a nearly identical manner, so no one SEAL is indispensable to the unit or the mission. The understanding during combat is that anyone can be lost at any time and the rest of the unit can carry on the mission successfully. Businesses need to ensure contingency plans are in place for any unforeseen personnel circumstances within their organization so the team can carry on without any delays.<strong>5. You never know the measure of a person until they are tested</strong><br> People are more resilient and tougher than imagined. During SEAL training, instructors prove that their men are capable of ten times more than what they ever imagined. Until your team is really tested, you can never be too sure who will step-up and who will falter in any given situation.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

I&#x2019;m talking about customer service where you&#x2019;ve walked away from spending your hard earned dollars on something you&#x2019;ve waited a long time to buy, where you&#x2019;ve saved diligently for something special and the service you received was so exceptional, memorable and entertaining that you just smiled and had to tell someone? It doesn&#x2019;t happen very often but when it does, you remember it and want to share it.My wife and I recently took a trip to Napa Valley to celebrate a milestone anniversary and explore the wine culture for a Bulldog innovation project. Included on our list of must-dos was a trip to Thomas Keller&#x2019;s world-renowned French Laundry. We had high expectations for an amazing experience, but we both had very little idea of what to expect in terms of the details.The mystique is fueled because they make it almost impossible to get a reservation, a brilliant tactic to drive demand. They open their reservation line on a Tuesday for reservations two months later, and it&#x2019;s still virtually impossible to get a table. Well, we were fortunate that our hotel booked our table in advance, but to my surprise the reservation was for 11am, a wee bit early for lunch, I thought. Nevertheless, we jumped out of bed, dressed to impress, hopped in the car and made our way to the restaurant with plenty of time to spare (you don&#x2019;t want to miss your reservation time). As luck would have it, we got caught behind the stragglers from the Napa Valley Marathon, and we moved painfully slowly toward our culinary destination. Bugger, we were going to be late. I called, no answer of course, and I began to panic. This is a place you just can&#x2019;t be late for! I called my hotel, &#x201C;You need to call them to tell them about the marathon, we didn&#x2019;t mean for this to happen, tell them how sorry we are!&#x201D; Tension was running high in the car, but it got worse when we finally reached the right street and I couldn&#x2019;t find the actual restaurant. Stressed, my wife insisted on getting out and asking for directions.We finally pulled into the intimate gravel parking lot and&#xA0;it felt like we were the first ones to arrive. The charming brick cottage on the outside was abuzz with organized activity, and had the most sophisticated of settings on the inside. It reminded me of the home where I grew up in England. We were greeted by an immaculately dressed staff member who requested our names, and then out of nowhere, a purposeful man glanced at my attire which, on reflection, was highly questionable given the rules. My large scarf made me look like a member of the PLO and my jacket was not a blazer or a suit, but a Chris Evans on-stage rock star blazer. His very clear instruction was, &#x201C;Sir, please do keep your jacket on in the dining room&#x201D;, and I have to say that rattled my cage a little.He seated us and left us in the hands of our main server, who made our entire experience a pleasure from the minute we sat down. She made us feel comfortable and at home. We described ourselves as casual, rather than hard core, foodies and she artfully served with a careful balance of total conviction about the food and an approachability in her service and conversation about life and the details. The sommelier was just as skillful in designing our wine journey for the day, laughing with us and educating us about his choices. While the food was everything you might expect and more, the wine pairings expertly matching each course, and our intimate time together over almost five hours of world-class culinary art will be remembered for the rest of our days.For me there was a real WOW beyond the culinary adventure in the middle of this wonderful event. On arrival I&#x2019;d spent the first ten minutes joking and stressing with our server about my rock star jacket, concerned I was inappropriately dressed. But my jacket was a very expensive Paul Smith limited edition. With a subtle, out-of-sight explanation to the dining room commander, Lawrence&#xA0;Nadeau, the Maitre d&#x2019;, soon appeared tableside and effortlessly topped off our glasses of champagne. With a slight grin and Seinfeld delivery, he said, &#x201C;And Sir, that is a fine jacket&#x201D;, and then he was gone. Brilliant, subdued and artful expectation management. I wasn&#x2019;t a celebrity and I wasn&#x2019;t dripping in billions&#x2014;I was just another customer. But every aspect of our experience was managed with grace, subtlety and personality. These people are serious about the food and the service, but don&#x2019;t take themselves too seriously in the process. Masterful.On the way out I complimented Lawrence on the whole experience. He&#x2019;s been the Maitre d&#x2019; since the restaurant opened 18 years ago. He gave huge credit to Thomas Keller&#x2019;s amazing leadership qualities. That was a wow experience we will always remember.<strong>UNCOMMON SENSE OBSERVATIONS</strong><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an organizational psychologist and a firm believer in continuous development, I have often found myself in the position of advising people on creative ways to keep learning throughout their careers. I have worked with clients seeking to become &#x201C;learning organizations&#x201D; &#x2013;where individuals and teams are continuing to figure out what works through learning in order to outperform their competitors. Research, experiment, succeed, fail, learn, improve, repeat.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As someone who has dedicated his professional life to the topic of organizational culture, I realize that groups of people, over time and through collective experience, figure out what works and what doesn&#x2019;t. Doing so allows them to begin to bake into their organization&#x2019;s systems and processes methods for repeating successes and minimizing failures (or they cease to exist). Doing so allows members of these organizations to routinize processes and behaviors that lead to success so they can utilize their mental capacity on other things. Easy enough in theory.&#xA0;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The real challenge presents itself when the old ways of doing things that once yielded success stop working (or stop working as well as they once did). It is during these times that I often get people reaching out to me to help them figure out what to do in order to right the ship before things go too far afoul. In all of these situations, some common realities have bubbled up that are important to acknowledge.</span><strong>Reality #1: You don&#x2019;t operate in a vacuum.&#xA0;</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we all operated our businesses in an alternate reality where outside influences didn&#x2019;t affect us we would simply need to figure out the most effective way of delivering our products or services, optimize those processes, and watch the billions roll in. Unfortunately, the world has a funny way of &#x201C;rewarding&#x201D; companies that operate without adapting to external changes in the market. Just ask those typewriter manufacturers. Or Kodak. Or any of the countless other companies that were leaders in their fields until the world evolved around them and they had their lunch eaten (technical term) by a competitor who evolved faster than they did.&#xA0;</span><strong>Reality #2: Technology will force you to evolve faster than you may want to.&#xA0;</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No other external evolution has rocked the worlds of so many businesses as the advances in technology that we have seen in the last decades. To make matters worse (if you&#x2019;re on the lagging side of things technologically speaking) is that the pace that technology continues to innovate and evolve is getting exponentially faster over time.&#xA0;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This reality means that organizations that may have been comfortable having mastered life in a more static environment can now be quickly stymied or disrupted by competitors who are able to adapt more quickly or by a pesky startup that can nimbly adapt to changes to better meet customer needs and expectations.&#xA0;</span><strong>Reality #3: The networked nature of our economy means that incremental change is increasingly being replaced by exponential change.&#xA0;</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this is largely due to the advances in technology discussed above, it warrants its own call-out here. Mark Bonchek suggests in his article in Harvard Business Review that, &#x201C;Companies like Google, Uber, Airbnb, and Facebook focus on how to remove limits rather than set them. They look beyond controlling the pipe that delivers a product and instead builds platforms that enable others to create value.&#x201D; It is precisely this approach that unleashes the possibility of massive change.&#xA0;</span><strong>Reality #4: Ignoring realities #1, #2, and #3 won&#x2019;t make them go away.&#xA0;</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can certainly take the &#x201C;head in the sand&#x201D; approach and argue that Realities #1 and #2 don&#x2019;t apply to you or your industry for one reason or another. Your market share is significant or your balance sheet has never looked better. Famous last words.&#xA0;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ignoring reality doesn&#x2019;t inoculate you. You have spent years learning what works and your customers have rewarded you by doing business with you. Yeah, things are changing around you but your performance is still strong (for now). If it ain&#x2019;t broke, don&#x2019;t fix it. Sound familiar?&#xA0;</span><strong>Reality #5: There is a way out for you and your teams.&#xA0;</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The good news is that there are ways to position yourself for future, long-term success in this fast-paced operating environment but it involves doing something that comes very unnaturally to us from an organizational culture perspective. We must learn to &#x201C;unlearn&#x201D;.&#xA0;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those organizations that are able to outperform their competitors will be those that are able to see an impending change in the environment and unlearn what works today in order to adapt quickly to what requirements the new operating environment will hold.&#xA0;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And therein lies the real problem. We have forever focused on the importance of learning. What we&#x2019;ve failed to master is the power to unlearn &#x2013; our ability to take an honest look at our mental model and make the conscious decision to work outside of it. Destin Sanlin does a great job of demonstrating how difficult it can be in this TEDEd video. But how, exactly, do we master the art of unlearning in ways that drive long-term performance? Here are a few things to think about.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those individuals and organizations that will excel in the dynamic markets of tomorrow will be those who are able to knock themselves out of the &#x201C;rut&#x201D; of success and challenge themselves to unlearn what has always worked for them in order to test their assumptions and beliefs. Only in doing this will they be able to identify areas where their &#x201C;usual way of doing things&#x201D; may threaten their future success.&#xA0;</span><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Well, nothing has changed. We all still hate our jobs.Wait, that&#x2019;s not quite right. A third of us are engaged at work. We love our jobs. But the other two-thirds, according to the most recent <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/reports/199961/state-american-workplace-report-2017.aspx\">State of the American Workplace</a> from the Gallup organization, are &#x201C;actively disengaged&#x201D; (16%) or &#x201C;just there&#x201D; (51%). Wow.That&#x2019;s a resounding vote of no-confidence in our current management practices. &#x201C;The very practice of management no longer works,&#x201D; says Gallup Chairman and CEO Jim Clifton. He calls for &#x201C;transforming workplace culture.&#x201D; Embracing purpose and identifying employee skills, &#x201C;strengths&#x201D; in Clifton&#x2019;s nomenclature, are solid goals.The needle hasn&#x2019;t really moved since Gallup&#x2019;s earlier 2013 workplace survey. Sure, engagement has increased. It catapulted from 30% to 33%. But, not exactly time to put up our feet and celebrate. In fact, it&#x2019;s time for something else. It&#x2019;s time to recognize that levels of employee engagement are not exclusively an issue for leadership. It&#x2019;s time to empower employees to take an active role in moving the needle themselves.Some of the happiest, most successful people have the ability to move that needle. They share one special quality that helps them do it. It&#x2019;s not a certain expertise or singular personality trait. It is an uncommon and very purposeful alignment of their exceptional skills, the values that guide their actions and true passions. When we see people who are driven and have a love for what they are doing these three areas&#x2014;skills, values, and passion&#x2014;intersect.These people have an abiding belief in their work and a commitment to doing it at a high level. Sure, it&#x2019;s work. But they don&#x2019;t act like it, and they don&#x2019;t talk about it that way. These are the highly engaged employees in Gallup&#x2019;s survey. And it&#x2019;s not simply because of their exceptional managers that they have reached this point. It&#x2019;s because they have found a balance that empowers them.And here&#x2019;s the most important thing. Anyone with self-awareness and commitment can aim for that target, for their own intersection. It&#x2019;s not particularly hard to align your skills, values and passions. By developing the self-awareness to recognize those areas in yourself, what you love is what you could be doing every day if you have the clarity to recognize it and the imagination to envision it.Let the companies keep working to define their purpose and to improve workplace culture. That&#x2019;s all good. But to really move the needle on employee engagement, it&#x2019;s time for employees to define themselves first. It&#x2019;s time to say who you are and what you want and then embrace the job that empowers those things. It&#x2019;s time to control your own destiny rather than leave it in the hands of the organization.Working toward something beyond our reach is what people are programmed to do. It&#x2019;s in our DNA. It&#x2019;s why we explore. It&#x2019;s why we discover. It&#x2019;s why we ask <em>why</em>. The siren song of the unknown, the yet-to-be-experienced, that&#x2019;s what inspires innovation, creativity and progress. That&#x2019;s what makes good great. And great is something we all have the capacity to be when we engage with the work in front of us.We don&#x2019;t really all hate work, not even the unengaged two-thirds of us. We just need to develop the self-awareness to position ourselves to do the exceptional work that matters to us.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"<em>What drives innovation? Is it the desire of a lasting legacy and monetary riches? Is it the desire for a common solution for a greater good?</em> <em>Perhaps the sole purpose of wanting to be disruptive is to change the way things are done?</em> Perhaps it is a bit of all of the aforementioned. Innovation is rarely a one-man show. It takes combined effort from a team of people&#x2014;but usually there&#x2019;s an underlying purpose that initiates the innovation of a product, industry, or procedure.Legends like <a href=\"http://www.thomasedison.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Edison</a>, <a href=\"http://www.teslasociety.com/biography.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Tesla</a> and the <a href=\"https://airandspace.si.edu/exhibitions/wright-brothers/online/\" target=\"_blank\">Wright Brothers</a> can be considered trailblazers of innovation. But these innovators also had a little help&#x2014;in the case of Thomas Edison he had substantial investment by <a href=\"http://www.history.com/topics/john-pierpont-morgan\" target=\"_blank\">J.P. Morgan,</a> while Nikola Tesla had the backing of <a href=\"http://www.westinghousenuclear.com/About/History\" target=\"_blank\">George Westinghouse</a>. No man is an island. When looking at the capital needed to foster their visions, innovation will always be plagued by the &#x201C;chicken or the egg&#x201D; scenario. One innovates and gets funding, or one gets funding and then innovates. There&#x2019;s no quick or easy answer or isolated solution.<strong>Vision &amp; Adoption</strong>Bottom line&#x2014;a company may have a good product at an attractive price, but it must also have the ability to foster widespread adoption to be considered successful.<strong>Knowledge Exchange (at every level)</strong>For an effort to be successful not only must it have interested parties who share common goals and interests aligned, but also, it must have a true bi-directional communication structure in place to make changes when (and where) they&#x2019;re needed.<strong>Management (senior)</strong>This is where resources are given or taken away. It is imperative that the individuals involved in fostering an innovative idea or concept have a clear understanding of the mandated short-, medium-, and long-term goals so they are united with senior members of the organization. It stands to reason that good listening skills are essential in minimizing misunderstandings and balancing expectations with those at the top management tier of the organization.<strong>Peers (mid-level)</strong>At this level, individuals involved must be careful and mindful regarding their roles in the effort and understand how to deal with others who are at the same rank. It is here where feedback must not always be taken at face value but rather carefully analyzed. To some, a &#x201C;pat on the back&#x201D; could be a sign that things are going in the right direction, while to others, a sharp criticism may be construed as condescending or even demeaning. However, constructive criticism may in fact keep people focused on what is important and be more valuable than placation&#x2014;something that encourages overconfident behavior which, in many cases, can be can become counterproductive.<strong>People Supervised</strong>These are the people one supervises and counts on for immediate support. Management styles differ from draconian to laissez-faire but most sit somewhere in between. As successful leaders know, helping people to be productive is crucial and supporting those under one&#x2019;s supervision is essential in reaching the organization&#x2019;s slated goals and objectives. For example, a manager who asks the question &#x201C;<em>What do you need from me to be successful?&#x201D;</em> will not only expose issues but also will help open an important line of communication between management and the team. This feedback works both ways and should be leveraged whenever possible to ensure everyone is on the same page.There&#x2019;s no question that organizational alignment is of paramount importance to innovation but so is making sure that this alignment is justified&#x2014;<strong>m</strong><strong>aking certain that the effort is on the proper path means listening to warning signs (e.g., cost overruns, poor performance, etc.).</strong> Not only does there have to be an alignment framework in place, but also there has to be an open line of communication at all levels to help steer the effort, which will call for both major and minor adjustments from time to time. As a result, knowledge sharing should not only be used in close confines but also promoted across an entire organization.Uncommon advice to apply to your business:Share your thoughts with us on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/bulldog-drummond?trk=top_nav_home\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn</a>.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Mario Batali&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://eatalyny.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Eataly</a>&#xA0;is a triumph in conveying the essence of Italy, and whether you&#x2019;re a retailer, restaurateur, or in the business of creating experiences, there is much to be learned from this well-curated brand.When most people think of Italy, what comes to mind are mouth-watering pasta with sweet tomato sauces, Tuscan farm houses, artisan craftsmanship, artfully designed automobiles, lovingly crafted housewares, and immaculately dressed exotic people. Italians have carefully nurtured a vision, and in many instances, portray the perfectly designed lifestyle through luxurious and rhythmic attention to design and detail. The Italian styled life includes flavor, elegance, simplicity and passion. Whether it&#x2019;s Tod&#x2019;s shoes, Gucci, Ferrari, Illy Coffee, FLEXFORM, Vespa, or Inter Milan, each does their part to perpetuate the romantic vision of the Italian culture through their brand.Mario Batali&#x2019;s brilliantly named Eataly&#xA0;in New York is a breathtaking food emporium that is a must-visit destination, and a living celebration of Italy&#x2019;s culinary wonderfulness. Visit Eataly and the name comes to life the instant you open the door. It is part living museum, part gourmet grocer, part happening bar and restaurant with multiple cafes and provincial foods from all corners of Italy, and beautiful houseware items all in one fantastically designed shopping heaven. And one would be remiss to not mention the immaculately dressed, gorgeous people inside.The romantic vision of Italian living is vibrantly alive in the halls of Eataly. The place is packed with people shopping, eating, drinking, browsing, talking, smiling and enjoying the experience of everything Italy. Whether by design or a stroke of luck (likely the former), this cultural mecca has brilliantly captured the essence of Italy in a store.<strong>From Merchant to Purveyor<br></strong>As the JCPenneys, Best Buys, Walmarts, and Sears of the world look at their future and maintain or evolve relationships with their consumers, they could learn a lot from the underlying fundamentals of Eataly&#x2019;s merchandising mentality by returning to the art of purveying and celebrating the products they sell rather than just merchandising them.<strong>From Merchandising to Tantalizing<br></strong>While one might argue that it&#x2019;s easy to tantalize the senses with food, an appetite for spending can also be roused through design. Apple certainly shows that with museum-brand simplicity meets well-lit club, and computers and phones fly off the shelves. And, Anthropologie&#x2019;s resemblance of a European outdoor market has made it a top shopping destination for women&#x2019;s lifestyle products. Very few retailers seem to think about their stores as destinations, but by not doing so they might be leaving business on the table.<strong>From Dull to Delightful Destination<br></strong>There is nothing dull about Eataly. It&#x2019;s a destination that encourages discovery and promises surprise and delight in each area of the emporium, guaranteeing a sensual journey rather than another average shopping experience. A brilliantly simple brand strategy subtly encourages and attracts consumers to spend more time in the store.&#xA0;Take a trip to Eataly for inspiration, and challenge your team to redefine your consumer experience through the energy of your brand.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"I recently read Bulldog&#x2019;s post entitled &#x201C;<a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/3847\" target=\"_blank\">What Next, Brand America?</a>&#x201D; with great interest. Shawn Parr&#x2019;s personal story of immigrating to the United States with the dream of achieving his aspirations through hard work is inspirational. I also took heed of the Arthur Laffer quote in the article, &#x201C;If you pay people to be poor, you will get more and more poor people.&#x201D; Parr shared an interesting and highly relevant concern that our nation may be &#x201C;creating a culture of dependency and entitlement where a lack of purpose overshadows the clarity of the American Dream.&#x201D;I also think the greatness of our country is directly related to people&#x2019;s ability to achieve the American Dream. It is the driving reason behind why I have been evangelizing that both economic development professionals and elected officials should be held accountable for creating the conditions that enable achievement of the American Dream.<strong>What is the American Dream?</strong><br> Xavier University has been formally studying what this dream is all about. They have created a unique and statistically validated measure that quantifies the American Dream in its entirety. <a href=\"http://www.americandreamcompositeindex.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The American Dream Composite Index</a> (ADCI) gauges our nation&#x2019;s well-being as a function of the multifaceted American Dream. The Index reveals the degree to which people believe they are achieving their personal version of the American Dream.One of the key findings from the research is that the American Dream is essentially a compilation of many dreams. The team at Xavier has used statistics to define five key areas that tend to capture most people&#x2019;s personal dream, including Economic (satisfaction with finances, job, home ownership and health care), Well-being (contentment with health and prosperity in life), Societal Context (the extent to which the government, businesses and people are fair and trustworthy), Diversity (the degree to which differences are assimilated into one&#x2019;s community), and Environment (extent of pollution in the air, food, water and land that is encountered). The ADCI provides insights into the sentiment of people across all five of the key drivers of the American Dream.Another key finding was that the definition of the American Dream in James Truslow Adams&#x2019; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Epic-America-James-Truslow-Adams/dp/1931541337\"><em>The Epic of America</em></a> was essentially spot on. He described it as &#x201C;The dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for every man, with an opportunity for each according to his ability or achievement.&#x201D; This is primarily the reason Parr cited for his immigration to the United States over 20 years ago&#x2014;and it remains the reason why so many people continue to immigrate to the U.S. from around the world.<strong>How Healthy is the American Dream?</strong><br> Based on the ADCI score for 2012, 64% of people believe the American Dream is being realized. On the flipside, however, that means one-third (36%) believe their American Dream remains to be realized. Perhaps this gap is what Parr is sensing when he says &#x201C;&#x2026;today, if feels like that dream is changing.&#x201D; Undoubtedly, people&#x2019;s perception of their opportunity to attain the American Dream has undergone some change&#x2014;and I would bet not for the better&#x2014;but the American Dream itself has not changed.If you look closer at the 2012 data and focus on the five key drivers, you can see where the biggest challenges lie. Americans feel better than average about the nation&#x2019;s performance in the areas of Well-being (index 108), Diversity (index 115), and the Environment (index 106). But they feel worse about performance in the Economic (index 97) and Societal (index 83) areas. This means people are disheartened about their ability to financially provide for themselves and their families, and don&#x2019;t trust that businesses or the government have their best interests at heart.In my opinion, this is an unacceptable situation and needs to be thoughtfully addressed. If left unattended, the belief that one can actually attain the American Dream will dissipate.The solution is for local economic development professionals and elected officials to begin using the ADCI data as a source of insight for local strategic planning. The ADCI data can highlight areas where a state (and soon MSA) has a competitive advantage or disadvantage relative to the nation and other states in enabling realization of the American Dream. Strategies can be developed and investment choices made to neutralize any disadvantages and maximize any identified advantages. The result will be barrier removal and enabling residents to realize more of the American Dream.It&#x2019;s not about jobs. It&#x2019;s about enabling more individuals&#x2014;and communities&#x2014;to achieve the American Dream. And, it&#x2019;s about time we hold economic development professionals and elected officials accountable for what really matters.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

They&#x2019;re all grounded in common sense and can be applied at home, in your professional lives, and to curate a vintage new year.<br><br><strong>Results Count</strong><br>Look back at your past year, perhaps the past three&#x2014;after all great things do take time&#x2014;and celebrate your successes and your failures. Your failures can be just as celebratory as your successes as they teach valuable lessons that provide the foundation for future success. Think about what you learned and what you want to change, then refine what success looks like for the year ahead&#x2014;setting audacious and achievable goals.<br><br><strong>It&#x2019;s Called Work For A Reason</strong><br>Many of us work too much. And although making a living and supporting yourself and those you love is important, you should always ensure you&#x2019;re doing what you love.<br><br>Revisit your values and what&#x2019;s important to you on a personal level. Those foundational principles should guide decisions around how you live and work. List the principles that are central to who you are and guide how you think and behave. Put your values to work daily throughout the year ahead in. Decide what you really care about and the role you can play to help make a positive change in the world.<br><br><strong>Make It Personal</strong><br>What you get out of this year, your job, the relationships you&#x2019;re in, and life in general is completely up to you. So take charge and make it personal. Adopt an own-it attitude and put 110% into everything you do&#x2014;whether it&#x2019;s the task you dread most at your job, or that chore at home you find yourself avoiding. Embrace it, own it&#x2014;what you put in will 100% impact what you get out. Ask yourself what type of person you want to be this year. Attitude is everything. It&#x2019;s up to you to make it 2014 a year to remember.<br><br><strong>Be The Dumb One In The Room</strong><br>Let&#x2019;s face it, you learn more from being the dumb one in the room than you do the smartest&#x2014;what&#x2019;s there to learn? Make an attempt to talk less and listen more.<br><br><strong>Schooling You</strong><br>Everything you do matters. Really. You are the sum of all of your words, actions, promises and relationships&#x2014;so make them matter.<br><br><strong>Brands Are Like People, People Are Like Brands</strong><br>People and brands can both learn from unplugging. It&#x2019;s important to set time aside to think about the big picture. Time is the most valuable commodity we&#x2019;re given. The weeks and months fly by, so plan your time carefully and don&#x2019;t waste it. Spend your time generously and make it matter.<br><br><strong>Always Be Learning</strong><br>Trust your confidence, avoid your arrogance, and reject ignorance. You&#x2019;re as smart as you set out to be. So pick up a book, sign-up for that class, start the project you&#x2019;ve been too scared to embark upon, run a marathon, or learn to surf. There&#x2019;s nothing like the excitement that comes from learning and doing something for the first time.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span><em>Photo: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/sookie/1490738885/sizes/o/\" target=\"_blank\">416Style</a></em>"

       "content_body":"Over my career training people all over the globe, one of the most common traits I notice is that folk are taking themselves,&#xA0;their work and their lives way too seriously.&#xA0;&#xA0;And when we take life too seriously and we feel burdened and heavy, we often show it on our faces.It seems like we&#x2019;re&#xA0;caught in a trap. Treating life like it&apos;s a&#xA0;competition that&#xA0;we must win.&#xA0;As&#xA0;a consequence,&#xA0;our energy&#xA0;gets jammed up.&#xA0;&#xA0;<br><br>There&#x2019;s a simple solution to this epidemic that&#x2019;s affecting the world&#x2026; Smile!&#xA0;Smiling reduces stress and improves your mood; it makes you more creative, more approachable and trustworthy, and improves physiology on a cellular level.\\In fact, if you smile readily enough you can rewire your brain to become more positive every day, so smiling isn&#x2019;t just for the moment, but for a better life altogether.&#xA0;So much of our time is spent being transactional and feeling as if we&#x2019;re on our own; yet we know that meaningful human connection has a huge impact on our happiness and overall wellbeing.Something as simple as a smile can activate neural messaging that not only makes you feel happier, it&#x2019;s actually good for your health too.A smile releases feel-good neurotransmitters in the brain; dopamine, endorphins and serotonin.&#xA0; These don&#x2019;t just relax your body, but they also help to lower your heart rate and can help to keep your blood pressure low too.&#xA0;All by simply giving someone a flash of those pearly whites.And it turns out our brains don&#x2019;t get too bogged down with if we&#x2019;re truly happy or if we&#x2019;re faking it. <a href=\"https://health.usnews.com/doctors/murray-grossan-112699\">Dr. Murray Grossan</a>, an otolaryngologist in Los Angeles sums it up brilliantly when she said, &#x201C;When you smile, the brain sees the muscle [activity] and assumes that humour is happening.&#x201D; &#xA0;&#xA0;<em>So, if our brains are happy to go with us on this and assume that a smile means we&#x2019;re experiencing joy and so release lots of lovely chemicals to make us actually feel great, then we really should smile more often, right?</em>It&#x2019;s as if our brains are willing us to smile...&#xA0;Smiling not only makes you feel better by releasing endorphins and reducing cortisol, but it also makes other people much warmer towards you and inclined to connect more deeply with you.It can even make us appear more attractive to others, and the more intense our smile then the more attractive we appear apparently.&#xA0; And even better (for some of us) a smile can even compensate for relative unattractiveness!&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0;<em>What more reason does anyone need to put on their best smile?</em>Have fun today.Because this is life, it&#x2019;s here to be played with.&#xA0;&#xA0;Smile and you can only win&#x2026;<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

The cost to our planet hits the trillion mark annually and with around 450 million people currently suffering with mental health related conditions it is one of the leading burdens to our healthcare system. Yet, according to the&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.who.int/whr/2001/media_centre/press_release/en/\">World Health Organisation,</a>&#xA0;nearly two thirds of people never seek help, as the stigma that still exists around the illness is very much alive and kicking.There are many reasons for this epidemic taking grip but one that is deeply evident is the demise of face-to-face conversation and a lack of awareness or openness about the things that are most important to us.Malcolm Gladwell&#x2019;s book&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930\"><em>Outliers</em></a>&#xA0;opens with the story of a community, the Rosetans of Roseto, Penn, that seem to be vastly healthier and happier than their neighbours. Studies revealed that what made them so healthy and happy wasn&#x2019;t down to food, exercise or wealth. It was the quality of their social network. They talked to people in their community every day. It was part of their day to day living; they had better lives because they took the time to talk and to listen, building deeper and more meaningful relationships as a result.Our individualistic and technology driven landscape, exciting as it is, means we don&#x2019;t talk as often. Not to real people. And the lack of, is ultimately having a detrimental effect upon our mental wellbeing.If we don&#x2019;t talk, we are essentially alone and loneliness has been proven time and again to make us unhappy. At any given time, more than&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/robert_waldinger_what_makes_a_good_life_lessons_from_the_longest_study_on_happiness/transcript?language=en\">one in five Americans</a>&#xA0;will report that they have feelings of loneliness. A recent&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-17475240\">Finnish study</a>&#xA0;showed that people of working age who live alone increase their risk of depression by up to 80%. We have lost our shine.&#x2018;Talk It Out&#x2019; is a super simple, free, fun, fast, human exercise I created a number of years ago. I am not a mental health professional. I have simply learnt what works through the experience of training many folk around the world. I also don&#x2019;t claim it to be the finite answer to the complex mental health problem. What I do know is that it can help our mental wellbeing. Lots.<strong>Why Talk it Out?</strong>We know how to look after our bodies by eating well and exercising, yet very few of us invest in looking after our minds.Our brain is a muscle, like any others in our body, that needs to be taken care of.<em>Talk it Out</em>&#xA0;gives us the space to do just that.It is the fastest way to process complex situations and gain clarity, energy and inspiration and release our bottled-up emotions.When we walk and talk, we access more of our subconscious and therefore much of our unseen challenges, frustrations and untapped passions come out into the light of day from the shadows of our more unconscious processing. For every opportunity that we have, we have a story. The story is our take on a situation, the one we keep coming back to time and time again. The one that keeps us stuck in today.Just by sharing in a stream of consciousness you can change a relationship with what has literally been &#x201C;on your mind&#x201D;.<strong>How to&#xA0;</strong><em><strong>Talk it Out</strong></em><strong>.</strong>Find a place to meet where you can walk easily and safely. Set up expectations around confidentiality and having an open mind.Pair up (one of you is A and the other, imaginatively is B!)Person A talks at person B, uncensored and constantly at person B about an issue they face or life in general. It doesn&#x2019;t matter what you say, nor does it need to make sense. Walk at the same time.Do this for 20 minutes.Person B listens actively, encouraging Person A to keep going but doesn&#x2019;t talk &#x2013; just listens regardless of what they say.<strong>Note &#x2013; Active listening involves listening with all senses.&#xA0; As well as giving full attention to the speaker, it is important that the &#x2018;active listener&#x2019; is also &#x2018;seen&#x2019; to be listening &#x2013; it&#x2019;s cues like &#x2018;Yes&#x2019; &#x201C;Hmmm&#x2019; or nodding your head or using eye movement</strong>Person B listens for changes in the energy of person A.After 20 mins just spend a few minutes landing where they&#x2019;ve got to. Nice chat to have.You can do a mini warm up session of 2 minutes each way to get people into the flow.I&apos;ve run this technique with tens of thousands of people and have researched it with Bristol University in the UK where we found that 85% of people felt better after Talk it Out.I&#x2019;m passionate about using the technique to help people to process complex situations and gain clarity, energy and inspiration through the power of authentic conversations.&#xA0; So I&#x2019;ve set Talk It Out up as a social enterprise that&#x2019;s free for anyone to use around the world.Give it a try and see how you feel&#x2026;<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

We believe that good commencement speeches are excellent sources of uncommon wisdom, so we&#x2019;ve decided to share some of our favorites. If you missed the first one, check it out <a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/appreciate-every-traffic-jam\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.The second speech that we&#x2019;ve chosen to share was delivered by <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0923736/\" target=\"_blank\">Joss Whedon</a>, a writer best known for his work on Toy Story and the Avengers films. <a href=\"http://newsletter.blogs.wesleyan.edu/2013/05/26/whedoncommencement/\" target=\"_blank\">Whedon&#x2019;s message</a> is that we must embrace contradictions, because life is full of them.There is a great contradiction that exists between our minds and bodies. Our minds want us to go out into the world and achieve great things, while our bodies, on a cellular level, want to make babies and then die, essentially.<strong>Contradiction is a constant in our lives and in our identities.</strong>We make decisions, we choose certain paths and we have an idea of who we are. But on some level we are doing the opposite, we will <em>be </em>the opposite. Whedon says that this is a good thing because &#x201C;you have&#x2026;[the] ability and the responsibility to listen to the dissent in yourself, to at least give it the floor, because it is the key&#x2014;not only to consciousness, but to real growth. To accept duality is to earn identity. And identity is something that you are constantly earning. It is not just who you are. It is a process that you must be active in.&#x201D;<strong>To accept duality is to earn identity. </strong>Whether we accept it or not, Whedon reminds us that contradiction never goes away. The tension in our lives will always be there, and there is no career, achievement, or relationship that will take it away. So, &quot;if you think that happiness means total peace, you will never be happy. Peace comes from acceptance of the part of you that can never be at peace.&quot;<strong>If you ignore duality, somebody else will sock it to you.</strong>If you ever somehow manage to forget about, or numb yourself to, the contradictions within life and within yourself somebody else will remind you of them. Whedon urges us to question ourselves because if we don&#x2019;t someone else always will. And if we have never considered the other points of view, if we have never challenged ourselves, our choices or our beliefs, they will be weak. <em>&#x201C;</em>You don&#x2019;t believe me, try taking a stand on just one leg&#x2026;The only way really to understand your position and its worth is to understand the opposite.&#x201D;<strong>America doesn&#x2019;t do well with the grey area.</strong>And this is where Whedon&#x2019;s uncommon sense wisdom becomes especially relevant. He reminds us that we as a country do not tend to do well with ambiguity &#x2013; our country likes to polarize issues and ideas, &quot;good or bad, black or white, blue or red.&quot;&#xA0;But that is not real, the world is more complex.&#xA0;<strong>Embracing contradictions allows us to find deeper connection.</strong>&#x201C;The way that we go into the world understanding is to have these contradictions in ourselves and see them in other people and not judge them for it.&#x201D; Because we are all connected to one another, in spite of, and sometimes because of, our disagreements. Connection, contradiction and tension are inextricably tied together. But connection is so much more meaningful when we are able to listen to the contradictions and sit with the tension.How different might our country look if we as a nation were better at appreciating contradictions? What about our lives, work and relationships? What are your contradictions?&#xA0;&#xA0;<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wn866ryQ5RY\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "principle":"THE ART OF THE START",
       "content_body":"Several of America&#x2019;s greatest 20<sup>th</sup> Century industrialists mastered the art of the restart. Thomas J. Watson Sr., traditional founder of IBM, lived for four years under the threat of imprisonment for possibly violating the Sherman Antitrust Act; his restart founded a corporation that not only required gentlemanly dress on the outside but employees of unquestionable business integrity on the inside. George Eastman, founder of the Eastman Kodak Company, had his moment of awakening looking out over a major distributor&#x2019;s warehouse full of his company&#x2019;s spoiled product; his restart, after more than 470 experiments to fix the problem, added a fifth principle to his business rules of engagement: control of the alternative.<strong>Never blindly follow the crowd.<br></strong>John H. Patterson, founder of the National Cash Register Corporation (NCR), had his restart moment too. When he started the NCR Corporation he viewed his workers like many of the industrialists of his day. He believed that people were to be hired at the &#x201C;lowest possible wage, worked as hard as they could be worked, and then fired when anyone felt like firing them.&#x201D; These labor practices brought him to the edge of corporate failure.<strong>How we fail is not as important as how we rise back up.<br></strong>NCR had just shipped its first large international export of cash registers to England. The necessary changes were made to transition the machines from counting dollars and cents to tracking pounds and pennies. They were to be an extraordinary overseas testament to the benefits of the cash register: reduce theft and provide business owners with more control over their cash flow. But the registers failed to add properly&#x2014;a major failing in a high-powered adding machine. Overseas sales clerks were accused of theft and fired. Store owners lost control of their money, and because of poor workmanship, Patterson&#x2019;s machines were sent home. With his usual flair for the dramatic, he amassed the useless machines in a pile and enclosed them within a locked, glass enclosure as a memorial &#x201C;for all time&#x201D;. It was a monument of junk dedicated to preventing another business failure.<strong>Sometimes it just takes a new perspective.<br></strong>At the time, Patterson did not know what the problem was, but he knew he needed to see things differently. He wanted to face his corporation&#x2019;s problems head-on. He moved his desk out of the corner office and placed it on the factory floor. With this new perspective, he immediately saw the problem: the factory was not a fit place to work. His factory took the heart out of a man. Samuel Crowther writes that what happened next gave rise to the modern-day factory floor&#x2014;a place where human beings worked in comfort and with self-respect to produce products through the highest of efficiencies.&#xA0;<strong>Observing and listening are the first steps toward change.<br></strong>From his new vantage point, Patterson resolved daily problems in his characteristic flamboyant style: one man commented that the place was too dirty&#x2014;that night the factory was cleaned inside and out; one night-worker grumbled that, unlike the day shift, the night shift had to wash in dirty water&#x2014;the chief executive stayed all night overseeing the installation of new wash basins; one man complained that the foremen had lockers while the employees did not&#x2014;the company installed lockers for all of its workers. Patterson then arranged for the employees to take two baths a week on company time because their homes had no bathing facilities; he installed a lunch room so people could eat in peace instead of in the midst of the ever-pounding machinery; he replaced stools with chairs for back support.<strong>Sometimes, it pays to be a little crazy.<br></strong>Although architects said it was structurally impossible, he built his new factory with more exterior glass than any of its day because he believed men and women would work better in light than in the dark. Finally, even though he wasn&#x2019;t making money at the time, he raised wages. As a result, his peers chided him and called him a fool. They deemed him crazy. To which he commented, &#x201C;It is an epithet which I prize highly, for I take it as a compliment to a vision that is denied to many unfortunates. . . There are advantages in being crazy!&#x201D;<strong>Don&#x2019;t be afraid to restart.<br></strong>John Patterson hung signs in his factories that proclaimed, &#x201C;It Pays&#x201D;. His employees knew what the sign meant: it was simple business math to invest three cents in a free lunch and clean bathrooms to get back five cents&#x2019; worth of work. It was a change that had a factory-, nation-, and world-wide effect; because it did pay. Sometimes it takes a restart to teach a leader what &#x201C;it&#x201D; may be.&#xA0;<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"<em>&#x201C;Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing.&#x201D;</em> &#x2013;Ben FranklinPeople are heavily driven by a deep connection to stories. Storytelling provides more opportunities for companies and brands than ever before in history&#x2014;from physical to digital experiences, product and retail innovations spanning media platforms and AI and VR technologies, the possibilities are infinite. Many brands have already discovered the power of storytelling and how compelling a well-constructed narrative can be.Recent scientific work is putting a much finer point on just how stories change our attitudes, beliefs and behaviors. Paul Zak, author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Moral-Molecule-How-Trust-Works/dp/0142196908\" target=\"_blank\">The Moral Molecule: How Trust Works</a> and Director of the Center for Neuroeconomics Studies at Claremont Graduate University has researched <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/10/why-your-brain-loves-good-storytelling\" target=\"_blank\">how stories shape our brains</a>. Research shows that stories release oxytocin and &#x201C;can help shape our brains, tie strangers together, and move us to be more empathic and generous.&#x201D; &#x2013;<a href=\"http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_stories_change_brain\" target=\"_blank\">University of California, Berkley Greater Good.</a>For brands and companies, this means that storytelling expands into a conversation to build on, an avenue to connect people to a product or experience to connect and engage people in deep and meaningful ways. Nike is a great example. For decades they&#x2019;ve created countless events and designed seamless experiences that connect people to their purpose in meaningful ways. Consider a few of their retail experiences&#x2014;<a href=\"http://news.nike.com/news/nike-soho-first-look\" target=\"_blank\">New York&#x2019;s service-focused SoHo</a> location and <a href=\"http://news.nike.com/news/nike-miami-first-look\" target=\"_blank\">Miami</a>&#x2019;s design-focused location have been intentionally designed to create a seamless connection between the brand&apos;s physical and digital platforms. And their newest <a href=\"http://news.nike.com/news/nike-jordan-basketball-experience-store-beijing\" target=\"_blank\">Beijing</a> location is an ode to the brand&#x2019;s commitment to the sport and culture of basketball. The 6,550 square foot basketball-focused space is an immersive experience featuring a Nike+ Basketball Trial Zone where visitors are invited to enjoy a half court set and an instant personalization studio with NIKEiD to create on-demand apparel.When a brand&#x2019;s story connects with every aspect of their business and is communicated in all touchpoints of the organization, both employees and consumers alike will connect on a deeper level. Check out our product innovation work with Nike <a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/our-work/nike\">here</a>. &#xA0;By charting change you can begin to think about, and develop, stories that really matter and guide people through your product or service story.&#x201C;Creative language and narrative should be threaded throughout the product and the engagement space linking intelligently and appropriately to commerce space and social engagement.&#x201D; &#x2013;<a href=\"http://www.cultureoffuture.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jody Turner, Trend Forecaster</a><br> Narration is an effective way to connect people with change, influential data, new technologies, products and services. This conversation helps people learn and engage and will become increasingly important for product narration and the diminishment of screen interaction (or a move toward Zero UI or Zero UX). The rise of products like Alexa and Echo make narration literal&#x2014;a voice that touches us in new ways. The ability to speak to the end-user in ways that address their world and their context is becoming more important.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattmccuewriter\" target=\"_blank\">Matt McCue</a>, Editor-in-Chief of <a href=\"http://99u.com/\" target=\"_blank\">99U</a> shares his love for stories and has created a simple <a href=\"http://99u.com/articles/55367/telling-your-story?utm_source=99U&amp;utm_campaign=1984b15c1d-Weekly_05_11_17&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_bdabfaef00-1984b15c1d-145402585&amp;mc_cid=1984b15c1d&amp;mc_eid=b6d37ee790\" target=\"_blank\">five-step guide for how to tell your story</a> by building and developing a compelling and adaptable narrative.

As the storyteller, this is your chance to show your value: You&#x2019;re mining your own experience for insights others don&#x2019;t have, and trading that information for the attention of an audience who could benefit from it. In other words, what do you know that the rest of us don&#x2019;t?&#x201D;&#xA0;As McCue points out, &#x201C;there is no one-size-fits-all way to tell your story&#x201D; but there are five uncommon principles that make it be compelling and resonant.Step 1: Find your story by identifying your unique spin on a universal themeStep 2: Take us on an adventureStep 3: Reveal your strugglesStep 4: Add literary spice to jazz it up&#xA0;&#xA0;Step 5: Teach us something we can benefit from&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Providing value to your audience, something at the heart of any good story, will always make what you say worth listening to.&#xA0;<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"A lot of people talk about creating a brand experience. Miraya and Liang, co-founders of Dessert Goals, actually do it. &#xA0;We recently read about <a href=\"http://dessertgoals.com/\">Dessert Goals</a> in <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/levelup/2017/08/16/this-sharing-focused-side-hustle-is-all-of-our-dessert-goals/\">FORBES</a> and were instantly drawn to their brand story and uncommon approach. Dessert Goals is on a mission to bring festival-inspired dessert experiences to the world. They&#x2019;ve designed a multi-sensory strategy and a memorable product experience. And their mindful growth strategy is one that all brands can learn from.&#xA0;We had the opportunity to talk to the co-founders to learn more about their strategy to apply design thinking to a constantly changing product and create an immersive brand experience.&#xA0;<strong>Tell us about Desserts Goals, where did the idea come from?</strong>Miraya: Liang and I were friends first and love desserts. Last summer over shaved snow we got to talking and realized there wasn&#x2019;t yet a dessert festival, so decided we should start one. With my background in events and Liang&#x2019;s in design we felt like it was the perfect match.Liang: There are festivals for everything these days, and surprisingly, there wasn&#x2019;t one for dessert. We knew we would totally want to attend an event like this, and probably our friends would too, and since it didn&#x2019;t exist, we thought we should make it happen.<strong>You are traveling the world eating desserts. Do you feel like you&#x2019;re living in a dream? </strong>Miraya: It definitely feels like the dream job! We have a &#x201C;dessert research&#x201D; fund in our accounting so it actually is &#x201C;work&#x201D; and we can expense it when we are tasting desserts. Doesn&#x2019;t get much sweeter than this!Liang: I literally cannot believe my job is to eat desserts. I think my inner child could not be happier.<strong>An important element of brand is based on creating an experience, is there one uncommon principle you follow? </strong>Liang: I am obsessed with designing for all five sense. We take every aspect of the experience into consideration, not only what you see and taste, but even the music we curate is meant to give you vibes of nostalgia and fun. We also strategically place vendors around the room based on scent. There are a lot of things we take into consideration beyond just putting together a bunch of desserts in a room with a bunch of people.<strong>You create an immersive experience, can you tell us more about the multi-sensory strategy involved with designing your desert experiences?</strong>Miraya: I&#x2019;ve been planning elaborate birthday parties and events since I was a kid and have said I wanted to be an event planner since I was 10 years old, so I&#x2019;ve always been very aware of experiences and what elements will really be memorable. Liang and I map out the attendee experience from entry to exit and try to think of ways to surprise and delight at every step, from water while you&#x2019;re waiting in line, to dessert smells as you enter, photo opps, salty snacks as a palate cleanse and a sugary sweet soundtrack. We also try to think of things we&#x2019;d want to do with our friends and create an event around that strategy.<strong>Your designed experiences involved an element of discovery, can you tell us more about this?</strong>Liang: There are three key emotions we aim to provoke at Dessert Goals: nostalgia, discovery, and fun. We want you to be able to find your classic, favorite desserts. We also want people to discover things they&#x2019;ve never tried. We curate desserts from many different cultures to create a wide variety (Taiwanese pineapple tarts, Portuguese egg tarts, Hawaiian haupia pies, and Japanese red bean fish cones have all been past hits). In fact, we curate our vendors so that there&#x2019;s no category overlap at all. If one vendor is making cupcakes, no one else can, for example. It&#x2019;s fun, but also a challenge to hunt down so many different kinds of dessert!<strong>You&#x2019;re really great at crafting visual stories, tell us about your strategy?</strong>Liang: I spend a lot of time thinking through and shooting content for our Instagram. It&#x2019;s important because it&#x2019;s the first contact a lot of our guests have with our brand, and I try to make it a preview of what to expect at the festival itself. Bright colors, LOTS of desserts, and shooting it in a visually interesting and creative way is the vision. We want to stand out from how others typically shoot food and desserts.<strong>There&#x2019;s a hefty level of design-thinking in your brand presence, what is your process?</strong>Liang: Going back to how I want people to feel when they see the brand, the big driving factor is fun. Every design decision is based around conveying fun. Lots of bright colors, shapes and playful typography are tools I use to create a sense of fun.<strong>What are some noteworthy brands and people you&#x2019;ve worked with? Or perhaps would dream to work with?</strong>Liang: Dylan&#x2019;s Candy Bar was a childhood dream come true! Who didn&#x2019;t walk into Dylan&#x2019;s and wish they could walk out with all the candy they could hold? Our guests love that they can get free candy from Dylan&#x2019;s &#x2013; it&#x2019;s one of the biggest lines at the event. We were also really honored to work with Macy&#x2019;s. It&#x2019;s such a huge brand that I grew up with, and it was so much fun doing an event at their store.<strong>&#xA0;</strong><strong>In a recent FORBES article you mentioned that your growth strategy is to grow mindfully.</strong>Miraya: Both Liang and I have other projects we work on in addition to Dessert Goals and we also really value having free time and travel. I think we hear about so many of these overnight success stories with businesses where founders sacrifice their lives to make it happen. Right now Liang and I are both in agreement of finding the right balance of growth where we&#x2019;re still able to have a life and to work on other things. We&#x2019;re definitely open and excited about new possibilities but right now as just the two of us we&#x2019;re trying to be kind to ourselves and mindful in the way we grow.Liang: We are also mindful about how we grow and how that can impact the experience for our guests. Our events sell out in minutes, and it would be easy to find a bigger venue and pack in 10,000 guests and sell them all tickets. But we wanted to create an event that felt intimate and not overwhelming. We&#x2019;re picky about who we partner with, and we want to make sure that as we grow, we don&#x2019;t change the vibe of our event.<strong>&#xA0;</strong><strong>Social media plays a huge part in your brands&#x2019; growth strategy, can you tell us more about how you use it to connect? Do you use a company to manage your social media? Have you partnered with any influencers or brands that have been successful or exciting? Or perhaps not? </strong>Liang: I currently shoot all of our photos in house and manage our social media accounts. It&#x2019;s a lot of work, but I feel it&#x2019;s necessary to maintain the kind of style and quality we want! We love working with brands and influencers who have fun, colorful, and playful vibes. We did a shoot with Viva la Juicy&#x2019;s new fragrance, Sucr&#xE9;, which had a cupcake shaped bottle. That was so much fun to style and shoot, and fit perfectly with our aesthetic! We&#x2019;ve also said no to a lot of partnerships that we didn&#x2019;t feel were aligned with our brand, and are selective of who we work with to maintain our brand.<strong>&#xA0;</strong><strong>What are three uncommon sense principles you live by:</strong>Liang: 1) If it&#x2019;s not fun, it&#x2019;s not worth doing. 2) Everything should be fun. 3) Always focus on the smallest thing you can do next.<strong>How can others become involved? Events they can attend? Workshops? </strong>Miraya: We&#x2019;re in planning mode for our 2018 calendar with events in New York and Los Angeles, so if you&#x2019;re in those cities keep an eye out for announcements. You should sign up for our newsletter at dessertgoals.com to get updated on new events and everyone should follow us on Instagram @omgdessertgoals for the sweetest pictures.<strong>All-time favorite dessert? </strong>Miraya: It&#x2019;s so hard to pick just one, but a classic chocolate chip cookie is a go to for me. Warm and gooey and just a bit crispy on the outside, nothing can compare.Liang: Fresh strawberry shortcake, namely the one from Chikalicious in NYC.&#xA0;Want to experience Dessert Goals?

       "content_body":"Strategy and culture are such intimate dance partners that in any given situation either may lead. If implemented well, culture will cover strategy&#x2019;s missteps and both will magnify the other&#x2019;s successes. Working together can help soften the impact of economic downturns, react faster to economic upturns, anticipate strategic shifts within an industry, and innovate faster to extend success into new areas. The key to interlock strategy with culture is quite simple: evaluate if your strategy is encouraging a culture of human relationships or human resources.Corporations are social entities. At their most simplistic, they involve the cooperative efforts of two individuals. These two individuals may be one of a multitude of combinations: sales and development, editor and author, employee and executive, salesman and customer, or one of hundreds of others. It&#x2019;s hard to capture the financial impact of each human interaction as a financial equation, but human beings in a corporate setting interact for positive gain&#x2014;the intent of an interaction is never to produce a zero-sum game. And it&#x2019;s the same with the interaction between strategy and culture; strategy produces a culture of human interactions where one-plus-one is greater than two, or one-plus-one is less than two. It&#x2019;s in the best interest of the corporation that its strategy encourages a positive gain.<strong>Relationships and Resources: The Dynamic Duo<br></strong>Over the past few decades our best financial minds have come to view human beings as a <em>resource</em>. We have even changed the title of internal corporate departments from Human Relations to Human Resources. <a href=\"http://www.druckerinstitute.com/peter-druckers-life-and-legacy/\">Peter F. Drucker</a> wrote that a human being who is expected to only do what he or she is told without responsibility for, or sharing in the decisions concerning, their work is a resource. To counter this, he assigned management the responsibility to make the worker <em>achieve</em>. For the worker to achieve, he believed an employee needs to not only realize their livelihood at work but also attain social status, integrate within a social community and find personal satisfaction. Drucker considered this a measure of corporate performance&#x2014;extraordinary corporate performance that&#x2019;s based on powerful human relationships.<strong>A 1 +&#xA0;1 &gt; 2 Culture or 1 + 1 &lt; 2 Culture <br></strong>Gallup documented the powerful financial impact of human relationships in a paper titled, <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/27799/Investors-Take-Note-Engagement-Boosts-Earnings.aspx\">Investors, Take Note: Engagement Boosts Earnings</a>. They call such employees <em>engaged</em> and describe them as passionate; <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_J._Watson\">Watson Sr.</a>, founder of IBM, labeled these employees as <em>enthusiastic</em>. A great corporate strategy encourages its culture to use an individual&#x2019;s personal potential as its main power source. By employing individual energy into any process, a corporation multiplies (not sums) the benefits of its resources. Mathematically, the potential of a human relationship can be expressed as 1&#xA0;+&#xA0;1&#xA0;&gt;&#xA0;2; and the potential of a human resource can be expressed in the equation 1 + 1 &lt; 2. Because these human equations don&#x2019;t balance on a spreadsheet, culture is rarely found as a line item on any financial analysis.<strong>Treat People as More Than a Resource<br></strong>Strategy expresses itself financially through a culture of over- or under-achievement. Humans treated as a resource underachieve&#x2013;humans in a win-win relationship typically overachieve. The failure of corporations to recognize the impact on financial statements of a poor strategy expressed through their culture is a uniquely 21<sup>st</sup> Century phenomenon&#x2014;a major divergence from the great corporations of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century.<strong>When Strategy Loses its Positive Connection with Culture<br></strong>IBM&#x2019;s 20<sup>th</sup> Century strategy created a culture of human relationships. Its strategy was to build a business that would continue forever, balance the distribution of profits between its stakeholders, decentralize decision-making, and manage internal and external relationships through a corporate constitution of respect, service and excellence. Its reputation, character, and financial results are well documented in corporate history. IBM&#x2019;s 20<sup>th</sup> Century strategy produced a 1&#xA0;+&#xA0;1&#xA0;&gt;&#xA0;2 culture.<strong>An Uncommon Business Approach: Interlock Strategy and Culture<br></strong>People are not a lump of coal with a finite energy supply&#x2014;subject to the laws of mechanics&#x2014;awaiting the application of an outside force. People can self-initiate, grow, adapt, develop, evolve and improve their contributions. Individuals are the spirit of an organization. But this spirit degrades when treated like a resource&#x2014;becoming passive, uncaring and apathetic. When nurtured, employees are inherently self-energized, engaged, passionate and enthusiastic, resulting in supreme sales efforts, innovative thinking and a limitless, renewable source of human energy. Individuals, so inspired, surpass management expectations&#x2013;and teams of such individuals don&#x2019;t wait to be led but lead their corporations into the future.With people, relationships matter. In such relationships&#x2014;expressed through a corporate culture&#x2014;one-plus-one never equals two; unless it is a glimpse of two&#x2019;s fleeting shadow as the corporate culture passes by heading up or down. IBM&#x2019;s Watson Sr. summarized it nicely when he said, &#x201C;There is no such thing as standing still. You either advance or recede.&#x201D;Is your strategy creating human relationships or just more human resources?<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"I landed in the United States in&#xA0;January 1991 with two suitcases jammed full of clothes and a bag of&#xA0;anticipation. Greeted by a recession and the outbreak of the first Gulf War, it&#xA0;wasn&#x2019;t what you&#x2019;d call the best timing. But I could feel the proud,&#xA0;industrious, ambitious, anything-is-possible attitude that made the US what it&#xA0;was&#x2014;it&#x2019;s what many call &#x201C;The&#xA0;American Dream&#x201D;. I was determined to play my part.&#xA0;And over the last twenty years, I&#x2019;ve been able to accomplish more than I could&#xA0;have ever imagined, because I believed in, and&#xA0;worked hard for, that dream.All who come to these shores, pursuing &#x201C;the dream&#x201D; because of its availability to everyone is the heart of Brand&#xA0;America. It has an appeal, attraction and potential to affect meaningful and&#xA0;positive&#xA0;change. But today, it feels like that dream is changing.<strong>Is the dream becoming a nightmare?</strong><br> When I arrived,&#xA0;America was united. The dream was built on principles and values&#xA0;that everyone understood. People knew that if they worked hard, they&#xA0;could achieve anything. But it was clear nobody was going&#xA0;to do it for them.&#xA0;You could feel the energy back then. But&#xA0;today something seems to have changed, America is starting to feel a lot like&#xA0;the&#xA0;country I left behind. The&#xA0;ideals that were once this nation&#x2019;s foundation are clouded by&#xA0;a&#xA0;growing wave of dependency, uncertainty, violence&#xA0;and meaningless trivia.&#xA0;America is becoming a nation&#xA0;where <em>how y</em><em>ou feel</em> is more important than <em>what you believe</em> or&#xA0;stand&#xA0;for.&#xA0;Success is looked down on by many and&#xA0;those who have worked tirelessly to become successful are increasingly viewedwith resentment. It&#xA0;was Calvin Coolidge who&#xA0;said, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t expect to build up the weak by&#xA0;pulling down the strong.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s becoming uncertain what our leaders expect and how&#xA0;they view those who&#xA0;create&#xA0;opportunities, take risks, invest and sacrifice their time and hard&#xA0;earned dollars.&#xA0;We have millions in our country&#xA0;struggling and unemployed, and yet we give handouts and benefits without any form&#xA0;of contribution being required in return.&#xA0;The economist&#xA0;Arthur Laffer said, &#x201C;If you pay&#xA0;people to be poor, you will get more and more poor people.&#x201D; America&#xA0;is in danger of creating a culture of&#xA0;dependency and entitlement where a lack&#xA0;of purpose overshadows the clarity of the American Dream.<strong>America, we must dream</strong><br> History shows us that the most&#xA0;powerful empires have all fallen &#x2013; the Greeks, the Romans, the Soviet, and the&#xA0;British. Their collapse, while never anticipated, was always&#xA0;predictable. The American&#xA0;Dream is noexception, it is clearly under threat.&#xA0;The time for us to act is now. America&#x2019;s&#xA0;purpose needs to be clear and its principles need to be polished.&#xA0;America needs to continue to be a shining light in the world, a&#xA0;place where&#xA0;people can believe that hard work leads to hard-earned rewards, and where ideas&#xA0;and dreams can become reality. The American Dream has inspired me for more than&#xA0;twenty years. Without any expectations of a hand out, all I hoped for was&#xA0;encouragement and the opportunity to create value. I&#x2019;ve always believed that if&#xA0;you are industrious and&#xA0;hard working there is an opportunity to own a piece of&#xA0;the dream. But I always knew it was up to me to achieve that dream.It is inspiring to spend time with&#xA0;people who are on a mission to make their part of the world a better place, and who&#xA0;have the energy and focus to make it happen. And while the&#xA0;dream is alive and&#xA0;clear for many, there needs to be more focus on supporting and encouraging&#xA0;people to pursue it, believe in it and strive to achieve it on their own. It&#x2019;s&#xA0;time to&#xA0;invigorate the entire country so that people who feel hopeless can start&#xA0;to dream and those trying, can try even harder. It&#x2019;s time for a reminder that hard&#xA0;work can deliver a better life, regardless of what we call work. It&#x2019;s time to&#xA0;encourage and inspire every American to dream.<strong>America, we must do better</strong><br> Leaders&#xA0;are charged with creating aspiration and sharing a vision that unleashes and&#xA0;unlocks the potential of the people they lead. America&#x2019;s leaders must set a&#xA0;vision that inspires&#xA0;people to believe in the American Dream again because it sits&#xA0;at the heart of what makes this nation the greatest example of possibility on&#xA0;Earth.&#xA0;The world needs America to set an&#xA0;example of what it means to work together to solve problems, to rise above&#xA0;personal differences and find solutions to the significant issues&#xA0;affecting&#xA0;this country and the world at large. Democracy, responsible productivity, and fiscal&#xA0;responsibility are three areas our leaders could benefit significantly&#xA0;from new&#xA0;thinking. It&#x2019;s time for them to rethink how major problems are solved.&#xA0;John F. Kennedy said, &#x201C;We can do better,&#x201D; and there is no doubt we&#xA0;must if we are to rise above the mud&#xA0;we are wading in today. We are lethargic in how we are responding to the crises that faces this&#xA0;nation. Kennedy also said, &#x201C;Ask not what your country can do&#xA0;for you, ask what&#xA0;you can do for your country.&#x201D; This is how we should each think&#xA0;about our role as citizens of these United States of America. Being an American&#xA0;has&#xA0;a privilege and a responsibility that comes with it: to contribute and to&#xA0;show that we are responsible stewards of our hard-earned freedom. I believe&#xA0;America&#x2019;s best is ahead, because&#xA0;there is no shortage of opportunity,&#xA0;providing we work together. We must strive for, and create, &#x201C;better&#x201D; for those who&#xA0;came before us and for the good of our children.Now&#xA0;is the time for our leaders to go back to this nation&#x2019;s founding vision, core&#xA0;values, and principles and recommit and communicate their relevance to&#xA0;ensure every&#xA0;American understands and embraces them. It is the founding principles&#xA0;that should bring us together and fuel our belief that the American Dream is&#xA0;alive and this is a country where anything is&#xA0;possible.<strong>America, you can do better<br> </strong>Brand America at its core is an idea surrounded by a set of ideals, and the dream is America&#x2019;s promise to its citizens and the world at large. But when it&#x2019;s all said and done, it is up to each of us to keep fueling the dream and striving to uphold those ideals. As individuals we can do better if we ask what we can do for our country, not what it can do for us. And as corporations, we can do better if we ask what we can do for our consumers, not what they can do for us.For my part, I&#x2019;m going to continue trying to put industriousness, curiosity, compassion and optimism to work in every part of my life, focusing on profitability with a purpose and spending my time focused on helping others to realize their full potential. I&#x2019;ll operate from the premise that today is the best day of my life.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

Since then, Wearable X has tested and created a variety of products, improving their process, advancing their technology and innovating and evolving their products over time.<strong>&#xA0;</strong><strong>Innovation starts with asking the right questions.</strong>For Wearable X, innovation starts with asking the right questions. It&#x2019;s not always about solving a problem. &#x201C;You have to look at the human experience,&#x201D; Billie explained.Brands should consider what aspects of humanity are important and strive to understand what makes their product or service part of a community. From there, continue to ask questions about the human process. Billie went onto say, &#x201C;You have to think horizontally&#x2014;take information from [all] walks of life and build it into something else not related. That horizontal thinking and design&#x2014;that&#x2019;s where true innovation comes from.&#x201D;<strong>Intimately design for human existence.</strong><em>&#x201C;Design thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer&apos;s toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success.&#x201D; -Tim Brown, CEO OF IDEO</em>Wearable X focuses on human-centered design. Billie unpacked this further in saying, &#x201C;The parts of human existence that make us truly human, like intimacy, memory and community, we think that&#x2019;s important to design for.&#x201D; It starts with getting to know the people you&#x2019;re designing for, and from there, you question, prototype and break what you&#x2019;ve built until you get it right. According to a recent <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesnonprofitcouncil/2017/09/05/leveraging-the-human-centered-design-process-to-shift-the-way-the-social-sector-measures-impact/#55e780336545\">Forbes</a> article, &#x201C;This approach to placing stakeholders (who are the end users of services, programs and initiatives) at the center of the solution design process aims to more authentically address the root causes of society&apos;s most pressing issues.&#x201D;<strong>Wearable X brings together design and technological innovation to create a better quality of life, which is why their product-selection process is so important. </strong>Much of Wearable X&#x2019;s research and product-design selection are crowdsourced. For them, crowdsourced opinion is important from both a consumer and professional end.Most of their products begin with a series of patenting projects that their executive team believes in the most. During this process they present those ideas to their audience to see what resonates and consult with key stakeholders and mentors, asking for their advice and opinion.One of their first prototypes was a product they created for Fox Sports, Jersey X. The goal of the project was to create an interactive jersey so that when a user put it on, they&#x2019;d feel what the player was feeling in real-time, enhancing a moment in time with the user. Vibration cues this experience as it enhances memory. The experiment consisted of 3,000 kids and rolled out at the Super Bowl in Manchester&#x2014;and was a screaming success. &#x201C;Children are an amazing demographic to do experiments with,&#x201D; said Billie, &#x201C;because they tell you exactly what they think and give you real, honest feedback.&#x201D;<strong>Nadi X are yoga pants powered by machine learning. </strong>The &#x201C;Nadi X&#x201D; is their latest product to launch&#x2014;a clothing line with woven-in technology for easier yoga. The activated yoga apparel listens and responds to the user&#x2019;s body, guiding them through their yoga practice. These pants are designed with embedded technology that uses vibrational feedback, and they are 100% washable (<em>we were curious</em>). They work by communicating with the body to understand what part of the body is being used and then stimulating the user with gentle pulses around the hips, knees and ankles to improve their form. Users describe the product experience as &#x201C;joyous&#x201D; and &#x201C;delightful&#x201D;, and the product &#xA0;has quickly attracted a following of <a href=\"https://www.wearablex.com/pages/become-an-xperimenter\">Xperimenters</a> who document their experiences across the globe.See how it works: <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/228236214\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>A new generation of wearable tech is coming, and it will transform the way people interact with the world one product and experience at a time.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span><em>Photo: <a target=\"_blank\">Wearables</a></em>"

       "content_body":"The power of positive energy is addictive and, for me, fuel for life. I get up every day with the goal of helping others realize their full potential. Whether it&#x2019;s a company or an individual, I am inspired by the power of unlocking potential through a combination of passion and purpose. I am privileged to work with a huge range of amazing people of all ages with a wide variety of professional expertise. We are currently working on a fascinating new product for high school and college students and I had the opportunity to work and mentor a brilliant young man named Tim who described himself as an introvert.As part of the program I bought Tim a book called <em>Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Can&#x2019;t Stop Talking</em> to help him explore this self-described label. He told me how much he enjoyed the book so I asked him to give me his perspective. Here&#x2019;s what he had to say:If you&#x2019;re a self-described introvert, you&#x2019;ve probably noticed that introversion is commonly viewed as an unfavorable quality. As society has adopted the terms &#x201C;introvert&#x201D; and &#x201C;extrovert,&#x201D; there are a variety of definitions that have been used to describe these enigmatic terms.More often than not, organizations use personality tests to categorize employees into certain areas with specific expectations based on their characteristics. People tend to form their own perception of expectations of behaviors based on these categorized personality types. In some cases these tests are spot-on and offer insight into another person they may not have had the opportunity to see otherwise. However, I question the accuracy of these tests. How can 20 questions dictate how one will behave and react to situations without considering the person&#x2019;s current state of mind, health, and past experiences? I&#x2019;m not sure it can. Regardless of the accuracy of personality tests, people and organizations will continue to use them as guides for behavior.It is evident that Western society has a cultural bias towards extroversion because of the push toward the American Dream. We value those who challenge the norm, break tradition, stand above the crowd, and speak their opinions loud and proud. Our society is built upon creating these types of people. From a young age, our education system puts value on those students who adapt to high-stimulating environments and are comfortable speaking aloud in class, while questioning those who tend to be quietter and shy.It is because of this mindset that many introverts have been pushed to be extroverted when, in fact it is not natural for them to do so. Each personality type has its own strong qualities, so I considered the advantages of introversion.Reading the book <em>Quiet </em>led me to understand introversion on a much deeper level than what I&#x2019;ve been led to believe. The book&#x2019;s author, <a href=\"http://www.thepowerofintroverts.com/about-the-author/\">Susan Cain</a>, offers a revolutionary definition of the term &#x201C;introversion&#x201D; and makes an effort to put the &#x201C;Extrovert Ideal&#x201D; to rest.Cain exemplifies a multitude of her introverted friends, whom she describes on a complex scale and brilliantly ties in to portray a powerful depiction of the true richness of introversion.<em>Quiet</em> provides education and advice to help introverts understand how to effectively control themselves in social situations. It also sheds insight for extroverts to help them better understand introverts.My only wish is that Cain went more in-depth about how a home environment of extroverts can affect young introverts (such as myself, being the independent, introverted son of two extroverts). For me, being surrounded by extroverts caused me to seek withdrawal. To avoid the hectic environment, I chose to shut my door and turn on music. But what that did was give the rest of my family the impression that I was antisocial. The effect it had was resentment towards the other members of my household. And I have a feeling this may be the case for other introverts.Understanding what it means to be an introvert allowed myself to wallow in my inner sanctum. Others who might not understand their introversion may become self-conscious, unconfident, and may possibly develop social anxiety. Western society naturally tends to suppress introversion rather than letting it flourish. I believe allowing introverts to express themselves, can actually improve their confidence.With that aside, <em>Quiet</em> is still a rich, enthralling read and has something for people of both types to take with them&#x2014;for us introverts, it is a rousing manifesto of the power of quiet and for extroverts, it may be a key to understanding the complexity of their quiet friends. Being provocative as it is, the book transformed my understanding of myself as a mental and physiological introvert, and I have been able to better engage myself in different ways, and I hope it can do the same for other introverts out there.<a href=\"http://newbooksinbrief.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/quiet_the_power_of_introverts_in_a_world_that_cant_stop_talking_by_susan_cain.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2920\" title=\"Quiet_2\" src=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Quiet_2.jpg\" alt width=\"395\" height=\"232\"></a><strong>Advice and Principles</strong><br> Introverts usually work best on their own terms. Try to tailor your life, if you can, to allow for some alone time, where you can work alone and control your environment. Find your &#x201C;restorative niche,&#x201D; as it is called. Below are some of my favorite insights from the book:&#x201C;If you&#x2019;re an introvert, find your flow by using your gifts. You have the power of persistence, the tenacity to solve complex problems, and the clear-sightedness to avoid pitfalls that trip others up.&#x201C;You enjoy relative freedom from the temptations of superficial prizes like money and status. Indeed, your biggest challenge may be to fully harness your strengths.&#x201C;You may be so busy trying to appear like a zestful, reward-sensitive extrovert that you undervalue your own talents, or feel underestimated by those around you. But when you&#x2019;re focused on a project that you care about, you probably find that your energy is boundless.&#x201C;So stay true to your own nature. If you like to do things in a slow and steady way, don&#x2019;t let others make you feel as if you have to race. If you enjoy depth, don&#x2019;t force yourself to seek breadth. If you prefer single-tasking to multitasking, stick to your guns. Being relatively unmoved by rewards gives you the incalculable power to go your own way. It&#x2019;s up to you to use that independence to good effect.&#x201D;<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"<em>If someone were to lay out your personal artifacts, what would we learn about you as a brand? </em>Hates Budweiser. Loves Samuel Adams. But only the original Boston Lager. Wouldn&#x2019;t be caught dead in a Hyundai. Is wowed by an Audi; sizzles in a Bugatti. Dreams of curves: sexy curves of Philippe Starck headphones, the lines of a Calatrava bridge, New York&#x2019;s SoHo furniture creations.When he takes out his pen, it&#x2019;s always a Zebra with a micro-fine point. Black. Never blue. And he takes out his pen a lot. Partly because visualizing things in three dimensions is one of the two things he&#x2019;s really good at. The other is ideas. His test scores are off the charts when it comes to generating them.Whenever he travels, which is often, he races to the wharf like a harbor rat, and he secretly believes that hundreds of years ago, in a former life, he was a shipbuilder&#x2014;fascinated with the aerodynamics of vessels gliding through the water. Quit school at age 15 to follow his passion halfway around the world from the Netherlands to Maui, Hawaii. The surf siren called and a mad scientist followed.Can you picture this guy and the brand he represents?<strong>Meet Mark Raaphorst </strong><br> The inner brand of Mark Raaphorst, a.k.a. &#x201C;the mad scientist,&#x201D; mirrors the <a href=\"http://www.sicmaui.com/team\" target=\"_blank\">SIC</a> brand he created.Mark Raaphorst shapes standup paddleboards (SUPs). To many in the SUP world he is The Guy. He&#x2019;s responsible for inventing some of the most innovative technology in the industry like the Active Steering System (A.S.S.), a game-changing design that allows watermen/women to paddle on both sides of a board (when in the past you&#x2019;d have to paddle on the downwind side forever). That A.S.S. engineering put Mark on the map as a design guru&#x2014;someone who rethought the fundamentals and paid attention to different details about the SUP ride more than anyone else at the time. The power of his brand oozes out from every pore in his athlete&#x2019;s body and every neuron firing off in his brain. From the moment he wakes up and has his first cup of espresso (never &#x201C;contaminated&#x201D; with cream), he is in the zone, buzzing his next perfect shape.Mark&#x2019;s personal brand is 100% shaper and his job is 100% SUP. As the founder of <a href=\"http://www.sicmaui.com/team\" target=\"_blank\">SIC</a> (Sandwich Islands Composites), he lives and breathes it. He hones his senses about improving the ride, training himself in the art of observation, the natural laws of physics, the aesthetics of sexiness, and the passion behind cravability so that athletes and amateurs alike can all fall in love with the experience of being on the open ocean with nothing between themselves and the swells but one sleek, beautiful board.Mark doesn&#x2019;t consciously try to be &#x201C;The Guy&#x201D;, but the minute details of his life tell the story of obsession about creating the perfect ride. Although in the shop you&#x2019;ll see him covered in resin stains and red dirt, the truth is Mark likes his clothing, stained or not, with just the right drape, quick-drying fabric and clean style. Which is why you&#x2019;ll most likely see him in Quiksilver or Bluesmiths shorts. He&#x2019;ll only wear OluKai flip-flops or New Balance shoes. And Mark admits to being compulsive about socks&#x2014;when they fit right, he&#x2019;ll buy dozens of the same brand (Timberland).His music in the shop signals serious creative and technical work, starting with classical in the morning to rev up his analytical thinking about shaping better and better boards to high-energy afternoon house music to crank up the production juices in the factory, to the Juan Gabriel cool down soundtracks that end the day and nurture imagination.<strong>Why Being a Brand Matters</strong><br> To study all of Mark&#x2019;s personal habits, tastes, preferences, artifacts, props, soundtracks, and other accoutrements, you can come to only one conclusion&#x2014;Mark&#x2019;s brand as an individual cannot be separated from his brand as a master shaper. You&#x2019;d never catch him in a pair of Wranglers. Or listening to Celine Dion. Or drinking Sangria. Or heading to an American Girl store in New York City. Or wearing headphones that didn&#x2019;t reek of sleek design. Or sketching without his black Zebra micro-fine pointed pen.Every aspect of Mark&#x2019;s existence signals who he is and what he&#x2019;s obsessed with and that combination of brand elements fuels his life as a shaper.<strong>Getting Inside the Head of a Mad Scientist: Curves</strong><br> Of course, if you were trying to become Mark you&#x2019;d have to master one core brand element that goes beyond pens and shorts and shoes&#x2014;you&#x2019;d have to get into his head and figure out what really makes him tick. You&#x2019;d have to get out in the ocean and feel the waves and the wind and train all of your senses to tune into the elements of the &#x201C;perfect ride.&#x201D; And to do that, according to Mark, you&#x2019;d have to become obsessed with curves.If you were a race car designer, you&#x2019;d have to watch a lot of turns around the track to come up with the concept of anti-lock brakes (that originated with Formula One racing.) If you were working on creating the next generation of hiking boots, you&#x2019;d have to become an expert at what&#x2019;s required for a shoe to be flexible enough to go from base camp to 8,000 feet and also engineered with perfection so that the mountain climber&#x2019;s toes didn&#x2019;t freeze off at the summit. Mark has translated that way of thinking to waves and wind:&#x201C;A lot of my work comes down to curves. You want to give the bottom contour of a board enough curves so it&#x2019;s maneuverable but yet you want to keep it straight so it&#x2019;s easier to get going. You need to think about width to give a rider stability but not bog him down with extra baggage. And you need to think about weight. If a board&#x2019;s too light it can be fragile and act nervous and will not have any inertia, but if it&#x2019;s too heavy it will be hard to get it going.&#x201D;The only way Mark figures out how to train his shaper&#x2019;s soul is to get out in the water himself and watch the paddler move. Over and over and over. That art of observation is key to his personal brand and the SIC brand.If you morph the Zebra pen, the Timberland socks, the Audi engineering, Bugatti sexiness, the energy of house music&#x2019;s steady beat, the lines of a Calatrava bridge, the sleekness of Philippe Starck headphones and the soul of a river rat, you&#x2019;d come up with a master shaper. Those brand elements paint the picture of a person and that person conjures up components of the product he creates.What can we all learn about our own personal brands and the details in our lives that tell the story of who we are, what drives us, and the work we do?<strong><em> <br></em></strong><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"There&#x2019;s almost always a number of ways to view something. Oftentimes it&#x2019;s conversations, people and experiences that help define opposing views.&#x201C;What started as a joke, evolved into something much more with meaning.&#x201D;&#xA0;&#x2013;Jason Markow<a href=\"https://tekstartist.com/\">Jason Markow</a> recently set out to design a subscription-based product that wasn&#x2019;t close to his heart, but after a conversation with a friend, <a href=\"http://clayhebert.com/\">Clay Hebert</a><u>,</u> the idea became a beautifully designed package with a much bigger meaning.Jason&#x2019;s work history is embedded in design and e-commerce. For the past ten years he&#x2019;s been designing, creating and doing anything to make a living by selling items online or helping other people sell.&#x201C;Before I sold art quickly, today I&#x2019;m focused more on bigger, longer, more thoughtful and meaningful projects.&#x201D;&#xA0;Jason and his friend Zach initially approached Clay with an idea for a different Kickstarter project, but the trio became fixated on creating a <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/muchmore/nothing-in-a-one-of-a-kind-package/description\">Kickstarter for NOTHING</a>. Part of the idea was just to make people smile. The other part was the desire to create a perfect gift for the person who has everything. And maybe a touch of personal inspiration to understand how Kickstarter works. But perhaps the biggest inspiration of the project &#x201C;was to take power back on the word &#x2018;nothing,&#x2019;&#x201D; Jason explained.The initial catalyst was a health diagnosis that churned into rocket fuel.Jason had recently learned that he has a rare lung disease and was told by his doctor &#x201C;<strong><em>there&#x2019;s nothing you can do</em></strong>.&#x201D; Jason wanted to turn this statement into one with purpose and meaning&#x2014;and the Kickstarter project became the perfect platform.&#x201C;We thought we&#x2019;d have some laughs and be done with it.&#x201D;The original goal was to complete the Kickstarter on a short timeline, but the two quickly realized this project was developing much more meaning. They wanted to put their best foot forward and really focus on the strategy. The biggest strategy applied to the project was to slow down and really think through it&#x2014;from the design to the approach to the marketing&#x2014;and treat it like a new business marrying both new age strategies, like advertising and social media, with traditional strategies, like press and radio. &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t believe it. I never thought we&#x2019;d explore a route that way, but our driving force and values drove that component,&#x201D; Jason explained.To date, they&#x2019;ve collaborated with local brands and partnered with local breweries and coffee shops to bring awareness to the NOTHING campaign.What makes NOTHING unique is that it&#x2019;s a very weird build of social commentary and social commerce that would specifically interest designers. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a love letter to design a Kickstarter themselves. We&#x2019;re trying really hard to put our best foot forward. For the love of the platform. For the love of design,&#x201D; says Jason. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not about the cash; it&#x2019;s about the story we&#x2019;re trying to tell. It&#x2019;s a tribute to the people that use Kickstarter.&#x201D;Kickstarter really liked the campaign as it pokes fun of them and the forum in a playful way. What started as a joke evolved into something much more meaningful&#x2014;which is an opposition of most Kickstarter projects that start with funding in mind in an effort to get as much capital as possible. Not the case for NOTHING. This tongue-in-cheek collaboration reminds us that:There are no do-overs.Focus on the things the matter.Make sure you&#x2019;re giving 100%.Life is way too short to work on projects that aren&#x2019;t fulfilling.Put your best foot forward.Give full effort.Sounds like antidotal Uncommon Sense to us.

       "content_body":"<em>How Qualcomm has fundamentally rethought education in the workplace, centering on curiosity not classrooms as the life force of motivation and progress.</em>Imagine you&#x2019;re at work facing a new challenge, wishing for something that would kick-start your talents and help you jump forward in your skills. In this dream world, a genie would appear and present you with the perfect gift: a completely customized, instantaneous boost. You&#x2019;d magically be equipped with the knowledge and information needed, with precise coaching that would accelerate your ability to tackle the challenge. Your learning would fuel your inspiration. You&#x2019;d connect with a diverse community of people in the process. You&#x2019;d have access to a global pool of experts and peers who would all weigh in on your ideas. And you&#x2019;d never have to step foot in a classroom to learn exactly what you need to know.According to Mark Better, Learning Specialist Senior Staff at <a href=\"http://www.qualcomm.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Qualcomm</a>, for years there has been a lag between the type of learning environments we want and the way that corporate training has been structured. But, Mark and his colleagues are hard at work to coax the proverbial genie out of the bottle to fundamentally restructure on-the-job learning. <strong>The core concept is simple: start with the person, not the classroom. Create experiences for each individual that enhance their work experience with exposure to new data, connections to new resources, and ultimately equip them to grow. </strong><strong>Traditional Approaches to Learning Won&#x2019;t Cut It<br> </strong>The Qualcomm Learning Center has been tasked with bringing future of learning concepts to their programs to keep the 20,000+ global employees up to date with technological advances, leadership skills, management insights, and market information to fan the flames of innovation throughout the company. In the past, that has meant classroom learning, online courses, and specialized workshops. To forge a more compelling path, the Qualcomm team has launched a set of experiments to discover what makes us tick at work and how we can redefine what, and how, we want to learn. As part of their process, the team takes field trips to places like Google to study corporate culture. They immerse themselves in non-corporate think tanks like the <a href=\"http://www.gse.harvard.edu/ppe/programs/prek-12/portfolio/future-of-learning.html\" target=\"_blank\">Future of Learning conference</a> that looks broadly at education. They construct ways to integrate Lynda.com into just-in-time learning modules. And they launch pilots to explore how emerging technologies like <a href=\"http://www.panopto.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Panopto.com</a> can create better search options and how <a href=\"http://pathgather.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pathgather.com</a> can bring new dimensions to individual career paths.Mark shared one example of how the early experiments are playing out: &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve recently created an internal app store to bring development resources to mobile devices for Qualcomm employees.&#x201D; That will be just the beginning of the transformation to build a learning environment that nurtures individual curiosity and accelerates progress.Of course not all of us can take on the future of learning at a scale that Qualcomm can. But we can all apply what they&#x2019;ve learned so far to our own lives. When it comes to job-related training today, the old-fashioned, one-size-fits-all approach to learning won&#x2019;t cut it anymore. We all need to completely rethink how we&#x2019;ll all progress in our knowledge using a fundamentally new set of concepts as the heart of our approach, starting with new questions to guide us&#x2014;questions that nurture curiosity:1. What if on-the-job training was seamlessly integrated into your job?2. What if corporate training supported each individual&#x2019;s path toward developing skills and advancing professionally?3. What if education stimulated innovation and imagination with crowd-sourced input and collaboration?4. What if expertise from the very best experts and most provocative thinkers could be inserted into our brains?5. What if we could engage with teams of other people who are also curious about what we&#x2019;re curious about, and learn together from time to time?6. What if we could get feedback in different ways&#x2014;not just based on mastery of facts, but based on a coaching spirit, where people could help boost us toward our goals?7. What if technology was inserted into the process, taking the best of <a href=\"http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/nikeplus-fuelband\" target=\"_blank\">Nike Fuel</a> bands (setting goals and monitoring progress), <a href=\"https://basecamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">BaseCamp</a> reminders (organizing learning objectives), and <a href=\"http://cloud.feedly.com/#welcome\" target=\"_blank\">Feedly</a> (news aggregation) and <a href=\"http://www.socialrep.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Social Rep</a> (emerging trend data)?8. Could we all experience the <a href=\"http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Vulcan_mind_meld\" target=\"_blank\">Vulcan Mind Meld</a>, that classic Star Trek sci-fi fantasy concept, where we have truly seamless integration between what we want to become better at and the sources of knowledge?Satisfaction is what really kills most cats. And complacency. And sluggishness in changing to keep up with the times. But, in the case of building a culture that will drive innovation, a new breed of training can be designed to unlock the curiosity we all have inside to become more, connect more, and love our jobs more.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Catastrophic recession. Political unrest and violence seizing an entire country. Huge challenges in economic growth and education. A labyrinth of bureaucracy. All of these factors would make most of us wave our white flags in surrender&#x2014;or cause us to become greedy, look out for our own self-interests, assume bunker mentality, and either escape or passively wait for change to come.But not Francisco Manrique, who chose a braver, more radical approach as he faced all of those forces in Colombia a few years ago. Instead of blaming the system or abandoning ship, he did the opposite. Francisco decided to step forward and make himself part of the solution.Which switch turned on in Francisco&#x2019;s head to avoid becoming a victim and emerge as a change agent? Francisco decided to make it personal. All of it. And that decision led to a ripple effect that now positions him as one of the lead architects of <em>Innovacion al Servicio de la Paz,</em> the Innovation for Peace initiative, which is a bold bet to introduce new thinking to a very old conflict in Colombia.We can all learn the basic skills of how to make things personal by tracing Francisco Manrique&#x2019;s journey from entrepreneur to industry leader to social change agent. But more important, we can be inspired to personally adopt the mindset that he developed to transform from a single focus on building our own enterprises toward a broader, more powerful goal of helping to improve conditions for everyone.<strong>From Construction Entrepreneur to Social Visionary<br> </strong>As a business owner in the construction industry in the Bogota region during the 1990s, Francisco had built a successful enterprise, Soluciones Inmobiliarias, and employed more than 2300 people. By the year 2000, he was the elected head of the 1700 member construction industry group called CAMACOL (Camara Colombiana de la Construccion) when suddenly his world started unraveling. First came a national economic collapse that rivaled the 1929 Depression in the United States. Next, the security climate destabilized. Within a few months, two-thirds of the members of CAMACOL went bankrupt and many of them fled the country to seek a more hospitable economic and political climate. But Francisco stayed in Bogota.&#x201C;It was a shock to witness such rapid deterioration of the economic and social infrastructure. At first I definitely felt hopeless. At the same time, I hated the thought that our entire country was at risk and all I would do was stand by and watch. So, a switch went off in my head&#x2014;I decided I needed to be radically active and change the narrative from The Great Colombian Depression to something extremely bold. I realized I had to connect with people, one at a time, to envision and eventually build a future beyond the immediate crisis.&#x201D;<strong>Changing a Narrative Starts with Personal Relationships<br> </strong>Deciding to make it personal made all the difference for Francisco Manrique. He refused to take the role of observer, and instead created and communicated agendas for dramatic change with a wide range of people&#x2014;one at a time.The first bold move was to give, not ask. Francisco, along with fellow representatives from the construction industry, set face-to-face meetings with the minister of finance and the minister of development and volunteered their services to construct a blueprint for private-public sector collaboration. They asked everyone in the industry to step forward with them to contribute time and money&#x2014;a gutsy move at a time when construction projects were at a standstill.The government ministers were impressed when they saw everyone with skin in the game. The personal determination of the individuals convinced the government ministers that they could create momentum for new programs and set the tone to envision new scenarios for rebuilding the economy. They funded a strategic process to rethink their economic future and laid the groundwork for new industries and opportunities.<strong>A Decade Later: Political Pressures Go Personal<br> </strong>At the same time that Colombia was facing economic pressures, the grip of FARC (the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) tightened&#x2014;characterized by bloody anti-government conflict and violent crimes against citizens that began to choke the country between 1998-2002. President Uribe hit FARC hard during his terms of office, and when he brought down FARC leadership, it set the scene for new negotiation when Defense Minister Santos was elected President in 2010. Santos devised a blueprint for a new phase in the peace process, but it would require more than a plan on paper to bring about change. President Santos asked for a cross-industry leadership help. Francisco Manrique decided to contribute to his vision for peace.Once again, Francisco Manrique returned to his philosophy of making it personal&#x2014;how could the political narrative change? Was it possible that &#x201C;making it personal&#x201D; would open the door to breakthroughs in the peace process?Francisco decided to attach faces to the FARC narrative. He went out into the countryside, met people who had been a part of FARC, listened to their stories, and tried to understand. Then, in 2013 he decided to share those facts and motivations with the public through his blog. He even staged a public forum where one of the women who had been in FARC and was going through a reintegration process shared the details of her motivations and experiences. And, telling stories&#x2014;personal stories&#x2014;about the world of FARC changed the dynamics from &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a mass movement that we can&#x2019;t do anything about&#x201D; to &#x201C;It&#x2019;s people&#x2014;people who could benefit from a richer set of choices.&#x201D; These perspectives have been central to the establishment of <em>Innovacion al Servicio de la Paz,</em> the Innovation for Peace initiative, and provide new light to help move the bold agenda that the Government has set for the process with FARC.<strong>The Radically Personal Imperative&#x2014;for Business Innovation and for Social Change<br> </strong>It would be na&#xEF;ve to assume that simply creating personal connections and volunteering to &#x201C;assign ourselves&#x201D; to be leaders is a magical cure for complex economic and political situations. But one thing Francisco knows for sure is that the decision to make important causes Radically Personal is a go or no-go choice&#x2014;you either step forward or forever remain a passive observer.1. Choose yourself as a leader and step forward to shift away from the status quo.<br> 2. Give before taking. Listen before speaking. The taking and talking comes later.<br> 3. Train for a marathon and be prepared to lose some of the sprint competitions.<br> 4. Connect to people and see the world through their eyes, their stories and their motivations.Talking with Francisco Manrique about how he envisions a new future for the peace process and economic innovation for Colombia reminded me of a Lily Tomlin line: &#x201C;I said, &#x2018;Somebody should do something about that.&#x2019; Then I realized I am somebody.&#x201D; We all have the choice to be that somebody.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

Her article had an underlining theme that is present in society today&#x2014;Change Happens and Size Matters. There are courageous companies in various segments ditching gimmicks and saying goodbye to the things people don&#x2019;t need. And it is the people who run these companies that play role in shifting society&#x2019;s perception.Over the past few decades the retail grocery market has been affected by many factors, not the least of which are economic and societal. In the &#x2019;60s the automobile transformed America, consumers ditched their boots and drove to the market. This moved the evolution from neighborhood markets to the rise of supermarkets. Next, processed foods hit the mainstream market offering consumers the ability to purchase an abundance of cheap food that could last for weeks rather than spoil in a few short days, which at the time was thought to be a good thing. Today, people are finding a new love for raw foods, and as such consumers are calling for the return of the local neighborhood market. They are asking where food is from, how it&#x2019;s grown, and the nutrient content and ingredients.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/sammogannam\" target=\"_blank\">Sam Mogannam</a> owns a neighborhood market in a very busy part of&#xA0;San Francisco. People line-up out the door and around the corner to shop at&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.biritemarket.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bi-rite</a> because Sam has created a community around food. At a young age he recognized the value of food and was bothered by the less-than-nutritious, preservative-packed food offered at most markets. According to Emily, Sam made a promise that if he ever took over Bi-Rite he would run it with his heart, not his wallet&#x2014;a philosophy Sam sticks by today. He is aware of the thousands of cheap products he could offer his customers with low margins and the slotting-fees he could acquire for shelf space, but he&#x2019;s not interested. Instead, he takes personal responsibility for each and every product on his shelves. Sam uses a rather unique decision-making model to stock his shelves: eliminate a popular item that makes him uneasy and take a risk on a product that he feels better about and positively benefits his customers, vendors and the market itself. Rather than just focusing on growing his business, Sam refines it by limiting options, tasting produce before it hits the stands, and turning down offers to expand his brand. His editing and focus on customer service account for much of Bi-Rite&#x2019;s success.<a href=\"http://surdyksflights.com/our-history\" target=\"_blank\">Jim Surdyk</a> also understands the importance of quality products and customer service. Surdyk&#x2019;s, a wine market and bar in Minneapolis has been in the Surdyk family for three generations, yet hasn&#x2019;t changed a whole lot. The family believes in uncompromising quality, versus quantity.The Surdyks know their stuff! Passed down for generations, their commitment to wine is outstanding, insisting on using online expert wine buyers, educated staff members, and cheese connoisseurs. Their fanatical level of expertise has created an outstanding reputation for the market, and a dynamic following.The dedication of their staff members and their knowledge of products, ingredients, and sourcing impresses me each time I visit their latest offspring, Surdyk&#x2019;s Flights, in the Minneapolis airport. It&#x2019;s a very small store that is able to curate a fine collection of products while creating a unique place for people to take a break, connect and shop. Aside from the thousands of passersby visiting the airport terminal Surdyk&#x2019;s experiences a daily dose of locals coming to purchase a bottle of wine for dinner or grab a sandwich for lunch.We can learn a lot from Sam and Jim, two business owners who have created successful companies and a loyal customer following by holding true to their values and directing their businesses with their hearts, not just their dollars.&#xA0;<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span><em>Photo: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/stefani_drew/4464371676/\" target=\"_blank\">Stefani Drew</a></em>"

       "content_body":"A Conversation with our Chief Content Officer, Megan Pilla.<strong>1. When did you start drinking beer?</strong><br> I was too young to actually remember the exact moment but somehow do remember the fact that it all began with my dad. I also remember that he fed Saltines and&#xA0;Tabasco Sauce&#xA0;to our Cocker Spaniel, which the dog would scarf down while simultaneously puking. Go figure.<strong>2. Beer you won&#x2019;t drink</strong><br> Anything below 5%. Why waste the calories?<strong>3. When did you fall in love with beer?</strong><br> I don&#x2019;t remember ever not loving beer, so I have to assume that it was the moment I first drank it.<strong>4. Why are you so obsessed with beer?</strong><br> I wouldn&#x2019;t say I&#x2019;m obsessed with beer. What does obsession really mean? Can&#x2019;t live without it? Can&#x2019;t think about anything else? Would kill somebody for it? Would kill yourself for it? If we go with the &#x201C;can&#x2019;t think about anything else&#x201D; definition then I could say, yes, I&#x2019;m obsessed with beer, and that my obsession is fueled by insatiable craving that starts around 5:22 every day and doesn&#x2019;t subside until I take my first sip of something delicious.<strong>5. Best beer memory</strong><br> I&#x2019;ll happily answer this question at the end of my life!<strong>6. Favorite beer of all time</strong><br> Any beer after not having consumed one for an extended period of time. Like going gluten-free, hiking for 16 days or just generally abstaining from alcohol for reasons other than having a terrible flu. But assuming that beer has been drunk on a regular basis, these ones always make the top of the list&#x2026;<a href=\"http://www.dogfish.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dogfish Head&#x2019;s</a> 90 Minute IPA<a href=\"http://www.allagash.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Allagash&#x2019;s</a> Curieux<a href=\"http://www.unibroue.com/en\" target=\"_blank\">Unibroue&#x2019;s</a> Terrible<a href=\"http://www.ommegang.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ommegang&#x2019;s</a> Tripel Perfection<a href=\"http://www.greenflashbrew.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Green Flash&#x2019;s</a> Le Freak<a href=\"http://www.ballastpoint.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ballast Point&#x2019;s</a> Tongue Buckler<strong>7. Most admired brewery and why</strong><br> If I could be another person in another life, it might honestly be&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.dogfish.com/company/dogfish-way/our-people.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Sam Calagione</a>&#xA0;of Dogfish Head (aka &#x201C;Poet of the beer world&#x201D;). In my opinion, he&#x2019;s been largely responsible for championing craft beer, but much more important and impressive than that is the fact that he&#x2019;s having fun. Recreating a recipe found in King Midas&#x2019; tomb. Having his staff chew corn to start the fermentation process for authentic chicha. Importing the second heaviest wood from South America and finding the last remaining father and son barrel making team to fashion it into an aging vessel. He&#x2019;s playing. He&#x2019;s experimenting. And he&#x2019;s having a ton fun. You taste that fun when you drink his beers&#x2014;his fun becomes your fun. That&#x2019;s genius.<strong>8. Best beer with food</strong><br> I prefer not to ruin beer with food!<strong>9. Best daytime beer</strong><br> I&#x2019;m not a good day drinker so this is a hard question to answer. Time and time again, I&#x2019;ve tried day drinking because it seems like everybody else who&#x2019;s doing it is having such a good time. Unfortunately, within the first few sips, the sun starts getting too bright, people start talking too loud, I start feeling too hot and all I want to do is take a nap.<strong>10. Most inventive beer</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.brewdog.com/shop\" target=\"_blank\">Sink the Bismark</a>. Brew Dog. 41% ABV.&#xA0;As anybody who knows me knows, I appreciate the extremes of anything&#x2014;&#x201C;the most&#x201D; and &#x201C;the worst&#x201D; speak to me at my very core. Because Sink the Bismark was the most alcoholic beer at the moment it was brewed, and because of the crazy process its Scottish creators undertook to make it, it was &#x201C;the most&#x201D; inventive beer. It was also served in a taxidermied squirrel. (Strangely, I actually think this attempt at being more inventive took away from the very inventiveness of the beer itself.)&#xA0;Subsequently the same folks have gone on to create higher ABV beers, which I no longer consider the most inventive beers ever, because they&#x2019;re simply incremental. They do have an&#xA0;&#x201D;Equity for Punks&#x201D; program&#xA0;that is incredibly, not incrementally, inventive. It allows beer drinkers like me to buy shares in their brewery, funding the very beer we drink.<strong>11. &#xA0;Favorite label</strong><br> Anything from&#xA0;Ommegang. As part of the Eastern enlightenment I experienced as a 16 year old, I got an OM sign tattooed on my body. My first name is Megan and my last initial is G. OM-MEGAN-G. How would anybody not like a label that so accurately reflects themselves?<strong>12. Favorite brew pub</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.toronadosd.com/toronadosd.com/Welcome.html\" target=\"_blank\">Toronado</a> in North Park, for the following reasons&#x2026;1. At any given time, there are a number of great beers to choose from<br> 2. They assume you know a lot about beer, and so don&#x2019;t tell you anything about the beers they&#x2019;re serving (including the alcohol content, which allows me up to make bad decisions like drinking multiple 13+% ABV beers back-to-back)<br> 3. It&#x2019;s a 5 minute walk from my house<br> 4. They have card games<br> 5. They have hot spicy nuts<br> 6. It&#x2019;s where I&#x2019;ve enjoyed countless beers with the love of my life<strong>13. Beer you&#x2019;d bathe in</strong><br> If I was relatively clean and just wanted to feel marginally more refreshed&#x2014;I&#x2019;d go with <a href=\"http://www.budweiser.com/en/_age_gate?redirect=%2fen%2fus%2f\" target=\"_blank\">InBev&#x2019;s&#xA0;Budweiser</a>. It is brewed to exacting standards ensuring that almost no impurities (other than those the brewers want) are left in the beer. And I imagine that the multitude of tiny bubbles would feel amazing against my relatively clean skin. If, on the other hand, I had just concluded a long backpacking trip, I&#x2019;d bathe in&#xA0;an unfiltered version of&#xA0;<a href=\"http://mikkeller.dk/\" target=\"_blank\">Mikkeller&#x2019;s X-Mas Porter</a>.&#xA0;In doing so, I imagine I would cover up any evidence of dirt (it being lost to the already dark, cloudy beer) making me feel like I was a little less dirty to begin with.&#xA0;Context is everything&#x2013;especially when it comes to bathing in beer.<strong>14. Worst beer ever</strong><br> Beer I&#x2019;ve bathed in.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span><em>Photo: <a href=\"https://www.brewdog.com\" target=\"_blank\">Brewdog</a></em>"

       "content_body":"If you work in the startup or tech world, you&#x2019;re probably familiar with the phrase, &#x201C;Get S*&amp;t Done&#x201D; or its more PG-rated cousin, &#x201C;Get Stuff Done&#x201D;. Both are used as refrains for a focus on driving results and as hiring filters to rule out folks who want to consult on a business rather than roll up their sleeves and do the hard work. I work at HubSpot, a software company with a huge emphasis on results and autonomy, so GSD is not just a poster at our company, it influences how we hire, how we lead, and how we retain and grow employees.&#xA0;Some people aren&#x2019;t fans of the expression, but I am&#x2014;I like working with people who aren&#x2019;t deterred by big, hairy problems. I think it&#x2019;s important that people who want to grow their careers (in tech or otherwise) don&#x2019;t forget that the term &#x201C;s&amp;*t&#x201D; is there for a reason. Simply put, you have to be a person willing to do the projects that no one else wants, the projects that require more elbow grease and collaboration than standard career paths, and that aren&#x2019;t a sure bet. The old expression, &#x201C;If it was easy, everyone would do it.&#x201D; is directly tied to having a GSD attitude.With that context in mind, here are three ways that constitute GSD and examples of people who live and breathe it.People who say they GSD are a dime a dozen given the phrase&#x2019;s popularity in the world of business. But it&#x2019;s significantly rarer to find people who truly represent the essence of the term and who are willing, able, and excited about tackling the biggest challenges, leaving excuses in the dust, and putting in the time it takes to Get S*&amp;t Done. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m a big believer in putting the s&amp;*t back in GSD&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a much more accurate reflection of what the phrase means and a significantly higher bar that true GSD people aren&#x2019;t afraid of.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"&#x201C;Passion&#x201D; &#x2013; one of the most overused terms in business without a doubt. Almost every brand celebrates passion on its list of values. Yet in our personal lives, it&#x2019;s a rarely used word &#x2013; almost antiquated. &#x201C;I feel a raging passion for you!&#x201D; I&#x2019;d be scared if I was on the receiving end of that one. Restraining order please.So why is passion so commonly attached to the DNA of many brands? And what does it really mean?Passion can&#x2019;t be plugged into a brand or an employee. It may be in the company&#x2019;s brand book, or the staff orientation guide, but that doesn&#x2019;t matter. It&#x2019;s a value that&#x2019;s organic and from the heart. And it&#x2019;s linked to another overused, but more realistic word &#x2013; &#x201C;authenticity&#x201D;. Passion has to be authentic. It can&#x2019;t be faked.I recently received a call from a recruiter representing Yahoo! In the course of a five minute phone call, she told me that passion was a must, but she also said that an MBA and an education from an Ivy League school was ideally required. Sure there are passionate folks who come from such a background. But if passion is truly key, this approach to recruitment, and therefore to the brand, is flawed.There&#x2019;s a big difference between being driven and being passionate. Passion comes from the heart, not the mind. So by excluding so many passionate folks in favor of a smaller pool made up of largely privileged graduates, the company is reducing its passion pool. Passion from the heart can open up the mind so wide that it can absorb the formal components related to the role. On the flipside, it&#x2019;s much harder to take a purposeful or driven career builder and inject them with passion.I am the former CMO of the Virgin Entertainment Group. I graduated from a reasonable university in the UK, but my passion overrode my career drive. I knew that if I indulged and focused my true passion, life would work out. And for me, that passion was all things music and media. So instead of applying to a million companies, I spent my time looking for one or two businesses that valued passionate people in their ranks. I recognized Virgin as one such brand, and Richard Branson as a passionate man who believes that a passionate culture leads to success. I became a sales assistant and then a display assistant at his retail chain for &#xA3;45 a week. If I could use my passion to the best effect, I knew it would be recognized as an asset for the brand. And it worked. I was running all marketing activity for the UK and Ireland within two years. In my case, passion prevailed.Passion is inextricably linked to culture. The two go hand-in-hand and are completely reliant on each other. And there lies the addiction component. It&#x2019;s the point of intersection between personal passion and the vision of a brand that places a huge emphasis on culture. Brands that celebrate and reward the impact of personal passion on achieving the company&#x2019;s vision lead to success.Sure, other factors are vital for success. But the passion of an individual can have a massive effect on those around him or her. It can&#x2019;t be injected into others, but it can inspire them, and once organically absorbed, it can become addictive to not only internal teams, but also to the company&#x2019;s customers.A great example of a passionate brand is Whole Foods. Just walk into their stores and you can feel an authentic sense of personal passion and expression at all levels, which is the basis of Whole Foods&#x2019; unique cultural and brand differentiation.There are other examples, but not many. Some categories are wide open for someone to take the lead. In these times of changing values in American society, businesses must start to think seriously about how true organic passion can be nurtured, celebrated and shared. As consumers, most of us could use a bit more of it in our lives. We want to feel good in our heart as well as our mind and our wallet. And that leads to loyalty.<strong>UNCOMMON SENSE OBSERVATIONS</strong><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

While he says that helicopter parenting and shielding children from conflict and hardship may have contributed, there is a much larger cultural force at play that has been ignored &#x2013; purpose.&#x201C;If you really want people to be tough, make them idealistic for some cause, make them tender for some other person, make them committed to some worldview that puts today&#x2019;s temporary pain in the context of a larger hope.&#x201D;Brooks explains that resilience doesn&#x2019;t exist in a vacuum. The grit and toughness that we revere in our culture are&#xA0;not innate. We discover these things&#xA0;when we have a greater purpose. He says, &#x201C;We are all fragile when we don&#x2019;t know what our purpose is.&#x201D; And this wisdom applies not only to Millennials, but to people, groups and companies of all ages and industries. Without a clear purpose we are all lost.He reminds us that purpose does not mean perfection &#x2013; even those with a defined purpose feel fear, pain and frustration. But if we want our children, our families, our employees and our companies to be tough and resilient, we must give them something bigger than themselves to live and work for; they must have a purpose.<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/30/opinion/making-modern-toughness.html?_r=1\" target=\"_blank\">Read Brooks&#x2019; full article in The New York Times.</a><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"<strong>THE ISSUE</strong><br> People in America shop at their local grocery stores, purchase food, return home, turn on their stoves with no fuss and cook dinner. Not everyone shares this same luxury. Traditional cookstoves and open fires are the primary means of cooking and heating for approximately three billion people in developing countries and The World Health Organization says harmful cookstove smoke is one of the top five threats to public health in poor, developing countries. Exposure to smoke created from these stoves causes 1.9 million premature deaths annually, and contributes to a range of chronic illnesses and acute health impacts such as early childhood pneumonia, emphysema, cataracts, lung cancer, bronchitis, cardiovascular disease, and low birth weight. The extended reliance on biomass for cooking and heating inevitably increases pressures on local natural resources such as forest and natural habitats, and ultimately on the climate.<strong>THE SOLUTION</strong><br> By providing fuel-efficient cookstoves exposure to harmful smoke can be drastically minimized, combating respiratory illness, deforestation, and climate change in the process. Today there are <a href=\"http://cleancookstoves.org/the-alliance/partners/\" target=\"_blank\">82 entities</a> fighting to reduce the number of inefficient stoves used in developing countries but there is one we&#x2019;d like to take our hats off to; <a href=\"http://theparadigmproject.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The Paradigm Project</a>. Paradigm has adopted the increasingly popular triple bottom line philosophy, which extends the focus of profit, to people and the planet.<strong>THE IMPACT</strong><br> Currently, The Paradigm Project has delivered 25,341 stoves impacting approximately 126,705 people, saving 1,445,974 hours looking for wood, 11,137 tons of C02 emissions thus reducing the overall carbon footprint and increasing local income from $3,804 in 2010 to $367,770 in 2011.<strong>STOVEMAN</strong><br> <em>Stoveman</em> is an inside look into a passionate humanitarian effort, a load of wisdom, intellectual enlightenment, and a bit of entertainment.

       "content_body":"Ah, the San Francisco Bay Area &#x2013; land of the startup. I just moved here and it&apos;s already become very clear to me that this is where people come to start businesses. Billboards promoting the newest technology line the freeways; meet-ups for entrepreneurs to pitch their ideas to investors are held every night of the week; coffee shop conversations center on development timelines and test markets.The intense focus on tech, money and rites of startup passage here makes me wonder if the foundational elements of startups get their fair share of attention. Perhaps it would be wise to revisit some basic startup principles and reaffirm why startups succeed.<strong>Start with purpose.</strong> Startups should be born to fill a real need &#x2013; to make a dent in the universe.Years ago, Jim Collins and Jerry Porras&apos;s book <em>Built to Last</em> conveyed the prevailing aspiration in the business world to build a company for long-term success. Then the late &#x2018;90s and &#x2018;00s ushered in an era of unprecedented abundance of capital and an explosion of internet-related business ideas &#x2013; and with them, the goal of a fast and lucrative exit. The integrity of your business concept mattered less, it seemed, than your ability to flip it.Now the pendulum has swung back toward building sustainable businesses and the purpose that drives companies is becoming the primary platform for startups. Simon Sinek explained one reason for this in his book <em>Start With Why</em>: &quot;People don&#x2019;t buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it.&quot; Today, in a world where products really aren&apos;t all that different from each other, a clear, distinctive, and purposeful mission and values can attract customers to your brand.&#xA0;Plus, the impetus behind a new venture propels its leaders through the challenges and helps them navigate the choices they face.<strong>Start with passion.</strong> Startups require some hutzpah &#x2013; you have to believe you&apos;re on a mission.The startup failure rate, which some estimate is in the 90% range, reveals the importance of substance and authenticity when starting up. Believing in the startup isn&apos;t as critical to its sustenance as is believing in the cause.Jodi Goldstein, managing director of the <a href=\"https://i-lab.harvard.edu\" target=\"_blank\">Harvard Innovation Labs</a>, recently said,<em> &quot;Authentic entrepreneurs are often what I call accidental entrepreneurs. It&#x2019;s not their aspiration to be on the cover of a magazine. They see a problem in the world and they want to solve it, and entrepreneurship is just a way to get there. The ones who show up and say, &apos;I want to be an entrepreneur. What do I do first? Give me the to&#xAD;do list,&apos; that&#x2019;s not authentic entrepreneurship.&quot;</em>Passion produces the commitment and focus to go beyond the start.<strong>Start with people.</strong> A startup is a human enterprise, made up <em>of</em> people doing something <em>for</em> people.No feat of technology will ever make a business without people. Assembling a team to make a breakthrough product isn&apos;t just about acquiring skills and knowledge; it requires the ability to inspire people to do their best work. Selling that product to customers isn&apos;t just about beating out the competition and converting awareness to purchase; it requires creating real value for people.Om Malik, technology writer and a partner at the VC firm <a href=\"https://trueventures.com\" target=\"_blank\">True Ventures</a>, recently created a stir in Silicon Valley with these words about the empathy vacuum in the region: &quot;<em>It&#x2019;s hard to think about the human consequences of technology as a founder of a startup racing to prove itself or as a chief executive who is worried about achieving the incessant growth that keeps investors happy</em>.&quot; Although he was writing about technology displacing workers, his call for empathy must inform how startups view their employees and their customers. Our common humanity cannot be forgotten.I&apos;m relatively new to the startup world, so these are observations I wanted to share before I get seduced by the start and blinded by the bubble. Right now, it seems the drive behind many startups is to make money, create something new and be successful. But these aren&apos;t reasons to start a company. They&apos;re the results &#x2013; if you do it right.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

He&#xA0;inspired the people of Great Britain with his defiant, heroic speeches, rousing challenges that&#xA0;were full of hope, humor and direction. By using language strategically, he delivered some of the most powerful and moving speeches that were broadcast across Britain and the rest of the world, including Nazi-occupied Europe. History now attests to the power of his carefully chosen and skillfully delivered words that moved a nation and ultimately helped win an ideological war of good versus evil. As one of the world&#x2019;s finest orators, Churchill is probably turning in his grave at what has happened to the English language.Churchill had very few weapons&#xA0;at his disposal&#xA0;to fight the Nazis, so he was forced to rely on his oratory skills and his powerful command of the English language. Content was his currency.&#xA0;He set the linguistic standard with well-crafted monologues delivered with passion and authority. People were craving content with substance, inspiration and encouragement. His words were carefully choreographed with meaning and sincerity. Imagine Churchill today, as a master orator with all modern communication tools at his disposal. He would be a prolific blogger, his Twitter feed would be constantly active, and he would have one of the most visited websites on the Internet. Churchill utilized masterful content as his secret weapon&#x2014;content was his currency and his means of mobilizing a nation to action.<strong>STICKS AND STONES WILL BREAK YOUR BONES BUT CONTENT CAN IMPACT YOUR STOCK PRICE&#xA0;</strong>Leaders today can learn from Churchill. When the correct words are used with sincerity and passion they have a mobilizing and lasting impact: they can affect employee morale, consumer relationships and impact your companies&#x2019; stock price.&#xA0;Great communication is an art and a science and needs to be treated as one of the most valuable currencies of your organization. Many companies have their obligatory mission statement framed in their offices but never use them to guide strategy or communication. Authentic communication as a meaningful currency comes from the soul of a company and is the first step to achieving a clear understanding and to answer why you really exist as a company. Crafting a compelling and living purpose with words that are carefully connected, easily understood, and passionately consumed is the foundation for meaningful communication.An untapped opportunity for innovation in many organizations is helping executive leadership teams to understand the implications of great communication as a currency for change and ultimately for profit. The personalities of the&#xA0;CEO and senior executives definitely set the tone for how a company&#x2019;s culture and internal content manifests, but many fail to understand that they indirectly affect external content as well. Content should be a living strategy and a currency traded between employees, customers and consumers, and it is equally important to the actual product a company produces.<strong><br> </strong><strong>WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?</strong>Just because your company can broadcast content via Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and YouTube, does not necessarily mean people are interested in what it has to say. People are drawn in by those who can entertain, educate, or intrigue them. Meaningless and forgettable content is ignored.&#xA0;Dull&#xA0;content is the equivalent of boring and meaningless conversations that are quickly forgotten. The digital world makes it easy for us to contribute opinions, narratives, pictures and videos to the conversation so it is much more difficult to stand out from the crowd.&#xA0;What your company talks about and how the content is delivered matters more now than ever before.&#xA0;Companies no longer have the luxury of communicating in a controlled monologue with consumers through traditional advertising. Technology creates an open environment where millions of people are vying for attention. With content as currency, companies must have something&#xA0;relevant, compelling and meaningful to say. Today, people respond to content that moves or entertains, so make sure your companies&#x2019; content is relevant and riveting.<strong>AN UNCOMMON SENSE GUIDE TO USING CONTENT AS CURRENCY</strong>Many executive leadership teams&#xA0;are still struggling to embrace content as the new frontier.&#xA0; Your company must be educated and immersed in the power and mechanics of social media and content development.Illustrate&#xA0;the power of relevant and compelling content by building valuable relationships to directly and indirectly drive revenue for executives.Use tools like missions, visions and values to set a strong foundation for meaningful, powerful communication and content strategy.What companies have to say, how they say it, and where they say it may not have the same impact as it used to, so make sure the content is interesting. Map out entertainment value, how it is relevant and what good it will deliver to the community.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"There&#x2019;s no doubt that the tourism and hospitality industries have embraced VR more than most verticals. While extremely variable in quality, 360&#xBA; hotel room tours and destination experiences are now commonplace. But this isn&#x2019;t the end of the story. Innovative VR opportunities abound.<br><br>One opportunity lies in the integration of VR experiences throughout the customer journey, rather than just at one point of connection. No one company has yet captured this space and it&#x2019;s there for the taking. Imagine an online booking service like Expedia or Travelocity being able to serve up not just the contents of a hotel room, but interconnected content that gives the traveler a seamless sense of how an entire trip will play out for them. This can start at a specific airport, then carry on through to the hotel, must see sights, dining, beaches, local transport and more. Editable, customized mix and match experiences would consistently reassure the viewer or enable them to pick a different room, carrier or excursion operator while keeping the most appealing aspects. The customizable VR journey could then be saved, shared and rated.<br><br>Feedback could be immediate, giving customer service representatives the opportunity to help customers more quickly and efficiently. All in virtual reality.<br><br>Of course this would require significant commitment from a variety of partners, each with their own specific goals. That said, full service tour operators are perfectly positioned to claim this innovative approach for themselves beginning with their own most popular packages and then moving on to long tail products once ROI is proven and third parties can be brought on board. <br><br>Then there&#x2019;s the opportunity to own the AR experience. Tour operators, online or offline guide publishers and national tourist bodies have yet to build truly comprehensive AR offerings which help the traveler to navigate, learn and share throughout every aspect of their journeys. Again, a full start to finish experience would distance them from their competitors and provide a useful service. After all when it comes to AR (and VR), ROI is unquestionably linked to usage and engagement. If it has genuine value, rather than gimmickry, consumers will be willing to pay.<br><br>Brands outside the tourism and hospitality categories should keep a watch on how things progress. There&#x2019;s going to be a lot to learn.&#xA0;<em>Read more from <a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/author/dave-alder#filters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dave</a>.</em><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"<em>&#x201C;<a href=\"http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/b/brucelee386184.html\" target=\"_blank\">A</a>&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/b/brucelee386184.html\" target=\"_blank\">wise man can learn more from a foolish question than a fool can learn from a wise answer.</a>&#x201D; &#x2013;Bruce Lee</em>Early in my career I was taught that good&#xA0;leaders must know everything in order to tell their teams what to do. When I asked, &#x201C;Everything, about what?&#x201D;, the coaching was helpful, &#x201D;Everything about&#xA0;EVERYTHING.&#x201D; Lacking perspective, I didn&#x2019;t spend much time thinking about the impossibility of this expectation as much as I spent time trying to execute it. I was&#xA0;naively optimistic that if I just worked longer and harder&#xA0;it was possible to know everything&#xA0;and fulfill the expectation.Fast forward 20 years and &#x201C;leaders&#x201D; are still trying to fulfill that expectation. You know the situation&#x2026; we&#x2019;ve all worked with THAT leader. The one who projects all the answers, experience and directives. The person who tells you&#xA0;exactly what needs to be done, even though a better solution may already be&#xA0;known.In contrast, what&#xA0;have I learned and observed in good leaders? Good leaders are not consumed with knowing everything&#x2013;they are extremely comfortable with the unknown. They don&#x2019;t prescribe solutions, give answers and directives, or require their teams to provide information that will not be used. They ask great questions, questions that drive clarity,&#xA0;engagement&#xA0;and accountability. They challenge and stretch people to always think strategically, analytically and executionally.To make the shift from <em>know&#xA0;it all</em> to <em>all is known</em>, here are five simple questions that leaders should consistently ask:<strong>1.&#xA0; </strong><strong>What&#x2019;s the problem we&#x2019;re trying to solve?<br></strong>In 2012, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkotter/2012/11/26/are-you-trying-to-solve-the-right-problem\" target=\"_blank\">John Kotter wrote a piece for Forbes</a> that&#xA0;used an&#xA0;excerpt from Moneyball to communicate how to reprogram thinking to achieve a better solution. Effective leaders ask this question to ensure there is clarity, proper focus and efficient utilization of resources.<strong>2. </strong><strong>What does success look like?<br></strong>Leaders want to know if the team has thought about the right outcome(s). Stop yourself from telling people your answer&#x2013;you&#x2019;re likely going to be wrong, or at a minimum, you&#xA0;won&#x2019;t be 100% correct. Focus on helping ensure&#xA0;the team properly defines the win.<strong>3. How can I be helpful?<br></strong>Great leaders serve their teams. Are you inspiring, teaching and&#xA0;providing resources for your team? If you&#x2019;re not serving your team, your employee engagement is likely low and&#xA0;you&#x2019;re not scaling your impact.<strong>&#xA0;</strong><strong>4. </strong><strong>What happens if we&#x2019;re not successful?<br></strong>Leaders always want a Plan B before there is a need for one. They look around corners and anticipate challenges&#xA0;-&#xA0;Murphy&#x2019;s Law&#xA0;(anything that can go wrong, will go wrong)&#xA0;is expected and employee accountability increases as critical thinking is broadened&#xA0;around scenario&#xA0;planning.<strong>5. What question(s) should I be asking that I haven&#x2019;t already?<br></strong>If you want to get your team to think about the big picture, you need to stop defining the boundaries of the picture. Every time I&#x2019;ve asked this question&#xA0;in any setting, it elicits the same response, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s a great question.&#x201D; Team courage and a values-based environment&#xA0;are promoted when members feel confident exposing leaders to their own blind spots.&#xA0;If you think you may be THAT leader, or demonstrate some of the characteristics, use&#xA0;your next opportunity to try and ask&#xA0;some&#xA0;questions. But, be careful to not ask questions in a patronizing manner, such as&#xA0;&#x201C;Being the dumb&#xA0;one in the room&#x2026;&#x201D; or &#x201C;Are you sure?&#x201D; False modesty or a doubting disposition will only undermine&#xA0;and unwind any&#xA0;trust you&#x2019;ve built within your team.All&#xA0;leaders&#xA0;can benefit from putting a mental speed bump between our brain and our mouth. The next time you feel compelled to speak up, ask yourself&#x2026; am I asking or am I telling?<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Fascinating isn&#x2019;t it&#x2014;how we can immediately like or dislike someone and then have our judgment be proven to be so wrong. Furthermore it&#x2019;s intriguing how so many of us are reluctant to confess to such instinctive human behavior.That first impression of someone&#x2014;that initial instinct sparked somewhere deep inside our soul&#x2014;coursing like a crazed snake through our blood&#x2014;increasingly supercharged by our impatient need for a conclusion&#x2014;all kicked off within a split second.<strong>Don&#x2019;t Get Me Wrong. Please!</strong>There&#x2019;s much written about this human process at a deep physiological level. Put simply, when we meet someone, all our senses are working overtime to assess microscopic subtle signals. The impressions gained are formed rapidly based on personal conditioning over time&#x2014;they&#x2019;re synchronizing in realtime with our senses. <em>The Good the Bad and the Ugly. That Movie That&#x2019;s Forever Playing In Our Heads.</em><strong>Don&#x2019;t Let Opinions Form You</strong><em>That handshake was weak, that dress was weird, what the hell sort of phone is that? </em>We have leaps of imagination and jumps to conclusions that form our perceptions. If we are honest there&#x2019;s a whole raft of considerations like these clicking away as we meet with people&#x2014;subtle cues that inform our opinions. And at some point during this jazz we&#x2019;ve made a decision&#x2014;<em>D</em><em>o we like that person or not? And we may not ever find out if we were right.</em><strong>The Dreaded &#x2018;Like&#x2019; Button In Our Heads</strong>Like? What does it even mean? A friend taught me something important about decisions. He said, &#x201C;<em>A decision is an irrevocable allocation of resources and it&#x2019;s not until later we realize if the allocation was positive or not.&#x201D;</em>&#xA0;Think about that. If it wasn&#x2019;t an irrevocable allocation of resources then the accomplishment would be a great intention&#x2014;not a decision.<strong>It&#x2019;s Precisely the Same with Brands</strong>If a brand cannot quickly or accurately express itself then it&#x2019;s often confused and misunderstood. People are outstanding at jumping to a decision when it comes to brands. Some we live to regret. Some we live with in a lifelong marriage until death us do part.Luckily for some brands, with deeper pockets, they have the slim chance to learn from these encounters. Brand experts are learning the definition of &#x2018;brand&#x2019; that I am describing here&#x2014;the definition that&#x2019;s way beyond look and feel, mood boards and brand books.<strong>A Way to Go</strong>I spend my time trying to &#x2018;read&#x2019; people and help them unlock the energy that&#x2019;s trapped inside. I do it visually, face-to-face and large, really large so it attacks all of their senses and gets them fired up all over. I get them to think of brand as everything&#x2014;I want them to understand it as forensically as if it were a living human being. I&#x2019;ve also been pretty scathing of the branding industry over the years. Not because I&#x2019;m not a lover of the field, or that there aren&#x2019;t brilliant practitioners&#x2014;because there are&#x2014;but because, ironically, the industry has not done a great job of branding itself.<strong>An Impossible Challenge to Brand </strong>In the past year I&#x2019;ve worked with at least 50 different companies. Admittedly the topic is usually focused on strategy, the future, survival and effectiveness&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s typically with the leadership team. On far too many occasions, brand is barely given lip service. The foundational topic of brand is often tacked on&#x2014;not built in&#x2014;and is considered distant to strategy in their minds.I&#x2019;m forever keen to make inroads&#x2014;shifting companies&#x2019; appetites for the idea&#x2014;moving leadership teams towards a meaningful evolution of their brands. And ?their reactions are visceral and polarizing.&#xA0;<strong>An All Too Typical Scenario</strong>How many times have you or your team arrived at that point with a client (or perhaps within your own workplace) where a new strategy or vision is executed, only to be told that the existing brand can&#x2019;t be changed too much. Or perhaps the discussion tails off because the appetite and capability to discuss all things &#x2018;brand&#x2019; just doesn&#x2019;t sit with this particular leadership team. In my humble opinion it proves what I already know&#x2014;<strong>brand, its critical importance and what it means to every single business on earth, is still woefully misunderstood as a field</strong>.<strong>What Businesses Need to Start Doing</strong>Unless, and until, businesses can understand that their brand is a living &#x2018;being&#x2019; and react with people just like we react with one another&#x2014;then they can expect to be passed over as instinctively as we all do with each other. A successful brand grasps subtle nuances. It develops a true understanding and meaningful relationship with every audience. It must be malleable, and at the same time able to weather the storm, binding the business and all those who sail within it for the journey ahead. Everyone in the company has to understand its personality. And the brand needs to know how to flex and change with time&#x2014;with the mood and the mode of the day, like humans do.Businesses need to understand that all senses are working between them and others at all times. They need to know how to show up, when to be quiet and how to genuinely expect nothing in return. They must have the grace and charm to empathize and be invited to speak&#x2014;to be there when required and not overstay their welcome. They need table manners. And they have to say please and thank-you with authenticity and belief.Businesses have to stop &#x2018;not&#x2019; keeping their brand promises. They have to stop thinking that coming into a room and vomiting their loud shouty voices until people walk out or buy in is not impressive in any way. They have to stop being annoying&#x2014;in particular when people don&#x2019;t need reminding of them. They need to stop thinking that the way they dress&#x2014;with that &#x2018;70s website&#x2014;is in any way going to get people dancing. They need to smell great. <strong>And they have to drastically reduce their chances of getting me wrong.</strong><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span><em>Photo: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/36766427@N05/6862813428/\" target=\"_blank\">philhearing</a></em>"

       "content_body":"<em>&#x201C;What you focus on expands, and when you focus on the goodness, you create more of it.&#x201D; -Oprah</em>Negativity is the automatic way of thinking for the majority. Evolution has left humans with a tendency to notice the negative rather than the positive. This <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3652533/\" target=\"_blank\">negativity bias</a> means we attend to, learn from, and use negative information far more than positive information. We tend to remember memories colored by anger and sadness rather than by joy.Although negativity has served our biological need for survival, we have the power to not only survive, but thrive. Why not choose to go beyond the daily grind of just getting by and instead enjoy the opportunity that every step presents along the way?In order to shift away from our default negative setting, we have to actively <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/science-says-you-can-reprogram-your-brain-to-be-happier-in-10-seconds.html?cid=cp01002quartz\" target=\"_blank\">train our brains</a> to focus on the positive. Small steps now to shift our mindsets can make a big difference later.<strong>What happens when we express gratitude?</strong>Picture this: a coworker, Steve, stops by the office of a peer and says, <em>&#x201C;Karen, you rocked it at the meeting today! That new idea you shared was epic! I&#x2019;m so glad you are on our team.</em>&#x201D;<strong>Receiving positive feedback motivates us.</strong>Karen, as the recipient of the compliment, is very likely to do better work as a result of receiving the compliment. Research sponsored by the John Templeton Foundation <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/it-pays-to-give-thanks-at-the-office-1438959788\" target=\"_blank\">found appreciation to be an even better motivator than money</a>. In a 2013 survey of 2,000 Americans on gratitude, some 80% agreed that receiving gratitude makes them work harder. Another set of research at the London School of Economics analyzed more than 50 studies to conclude that we give our best effort if others appreciate what we do.&#xA0;<strong>Expressing gratitude is good for us.</strong>The best part of gratitude is that everyone involved benefits. Both the recipient of the gratitude and the person expressing it will experience a multitude of positive benefits.According to a <a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/in-praise-of-gratitude\" target=\"_blank\">Harvard Health review</a>, people expressing gratitude will &#x201C;feel more positive emotions, relish good experiences, improve their health, deal with adversity, and build strong relationships.&#x201D; In addition, improved sleep, enhanced empathy and reduced aggression are also among the <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/amymorin/2014/11/23/7-scientifically-proven-benefits-of-gratitude-that-will-motivate-you-to-give-thanks-year-round/#4e68d74c6800\" target=\"_blank\">widely cited </a>reasons why we should all give more thanks to those around us.<strong>Challenge your mindset often.</strong>What would happen if we chose to be grateful frequently enough that we began to consistently see the good in everybody and in every situation? We can practice having an appreciative mindset by continually choosing to ask and answer questions, especially in tough moments, such as, &#x201C;What good can I see in this moment?&#x201D; Having an appreciative mindset makes us more readily available to take action to express gratitude often in an authentic and sincere way.&#xA0;Luckily, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=http://www.forbes.com/sites/chriscancialosi/2016/02/16/the-surprising-power-of-appreciation-at-work/&amp;refURL=&amp;referrer=#79c025734c97\" target=\"_blank\">the surprising power of appreciation</a> is that it multiplies. You can start to train your brain by reminding it to refocus on the positive in the person or situation currently in front of you. This is no easy task.<strong>&#xA0;</strong>But, when you do this consistently, you&#x2019;ll begin see there is so much to be appreciated around you in the present moment. Everything from the beautiful sunrise, to the smiles of your colleagues, to the feeling of satisfaction for a job well done.The wonderful thing is that what you focus on grows. The more you practice the art of appreciation, the more you will find to be grateful for. And it&#x2019;s a choice you can make every day. With consistency, it&#x2019;ll hopefully become habit. After a while it becomes like muscle memory, an automatic (albeit trained) response to the circumstances at hand.Having an appreciative mindset means refocusing on what you have rather than what you lack so that the journey can become just as enjoyable as the end result.<strong>Six Uncommon Sense Tips to Be More Grateful </strong>Share with us what you&#x2019;re appreciative of today so we can keep the grateful ball rolling!&#xA0;<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"At Bulldog we spend a lot of time talking about the importance of defining your purpose, in both life and business. We ask people and brands alike, &#x201C;What&#x2019;s your purpose?&#x201D; We believe it is fundamental to the long-term success of a brand to understand what it&#x2019;s here for and what it intendeds to achieve in the world. And while this is often one of the hardest questions to answer, it&#x2019;s not the answer but the follow-through that holds the biggest challenges and the greatest rewards.<strong>How you act in the world is subject to total transparency </strong>As this trainwreck of an election cycle crashes and burns, my disgust and disdain hasn&#x2019;t been fueled by the policies or purpose of the candidates, but rather by how they have behaved. We haven&#x2019;t experienced a series of intelligent debates around strategies that would put our country on a progressive, peaceful and prosperous path forward. Instead, we&#x2019;ve been subjected to a schoolyard spectacle of the insults, lies, excuses and peccadillos of each.It&#x2019;s been the painful destruction of the character of each candidate that has fueled the media circus in which we&#x2019;ve been saturated. We&#x2019;ve witnessed that the actions, both past and present, of these candidate brands are not Presidential. How they&#x2019;ve acted in the past is the only indicator we have of how they might act in the future, and that is cause for alarm. But this example of such profound dearth of character in the most prominent leadership role in our nation should not be needed to underscore the importance of how we behave in the world. Because no matter who we are talking about, character matters.&#xA0;Given the widespread access to information through both social media and 24/7 news circuits, whether we like it or not our character is on display for the world to witness. We are, as we should be, held accountable for our words and actions because they are available for everyone to see. And with the permanence of the internet, we can never erase or deny when we fall short. We can either fear the reality of transparency or use it as an opportunity to tell our audience who we are and show them what we stand for. It&#x2019;s easier than ever for both individuals and brands to be held accountable for a lack of character, but also to be revered for a wealth of it.<strong>You have character and everyone can be the judge</strong>Let&#x2019;s take a deeper look at character. What is it really? It&#x2019;s defined as a distinct set of mental and moral qualities; it&#x2019;s shaped by your beliefs and reflected in your actions. Character, and therefore principles, play a key role in guiding your brand so that you can live out your purpose with consistency.<strong>To be authentic, build from the truth </strong>Like a confident person, a strong and vibrant brand knows who it is and so does everyone it comes into contact with. It&#x2019;s built on truth and on a clear and compelling purpose that engages and inspires employees and connects in meaningful ways with consumers. It&#x2019;s built on a solid foundation that informs everything it does, and how a brand acts shows others what it values.&#xA0;<strong>Act with integrity, even when the mic is off</strong>A brand with depth must have character. This means that it must have clear principles that serve to guide actions of integrity. Integrity means that you do what you promise, you live by your word, and you do the right thing even<em>,</em> and especially, when no one is looking. A brand might have an incredibly clear purpose laid out, but if it has failed to deliver on it and failed to show integrity, it will lose credibility and trust. In fact, if a brand lacks the character, the principles and the integrity to uphold its purpose, it may as well claim no purpose at all.<strong>Consistency is the key to building trust </strong>Let&#x2019;s be clear, having a solid character is challenging. It&#x2019;s doing what&#x2019;s right rather than what&#x2019;s easy. Character is tested when the going gets tough and when difficult situations arise. It is most difficult to maintain your character in the face of challenges and hardships, but this is exactly when it matters most. It&#x2019;s easy to do the right thing when it is also the easy thing. But look at times of challenge as a test of your character, a chance to consistently prove the integrity of your brand.<strong>Character builds (or undermines) trust, and trust builds goodwill</strong>People will decide how to vote in this election based on who they trust or whether they feel they can trust any candidate at all. We may not have seen a strong display of character, integrity or purpose during this political season, but we will have to decide who to place our trust in regardless.As a brand, it&#x2019;s important to remember that consumers typically have more than two choices available to them. Whether they choose to engage with or buy a particular brand depends on whether they trust that brand. And consumer trust is earned by proving good character. So make a point of acting with integrity and using the multiple avenues at your disposal to consistently show your audience your good character.&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0;The United States of America was built on the ultimate brand purpose, laid out in the powerful documents that formed our nation, from the Declaration of Independence to the Constitution to the Bill of Rights. Our founding fathers laid out our collective purpose so that clarity was undeniable and all future leaders would have a standard with which to guide their actions. There is no doubt that those wise men are turning in their graves.&#xA0;In the midst of this national crisis of character, we can all take this opportunity to recognize the profound significance of integrity in our own lives, in our businesses and in our country. We all know how much is at stake over the next four years. If the leader of the United States does not at least try to live up to the character that our nation has claimed to represent for the last 240 years, we risk losing the trust of the global community.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"I recently heard an amazing story from Paul Bennett, Cheif Creative Officer at <a href=\"http://www.ideo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">IDEO</a>, that illustrated the power of quiet observation, saying less and listening more.In 2009, Paul traveled to <a href=\"http://www.grameen.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Grameen Bank</a> an hour outside of Dhaka in Bangladesh as part of a corporate tour party, &#x201C;Inside Grameen&#x201D;. It was sweltering hot in the small stuffy branch office as various officials spoke about the glowing wonders of Grameen, its local workers, and Grameen Bank&#x2019;s founder, the much-lauded Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus. The small, sugary tea biscuits and strangely incongruous mini-bananas he was given to eat were melting and swarming with flies. He was surrounded by curious, gentle-eyed locals with gazes fixated on the guest speakers. The tea itself, made with local water, sat there; they were all too afraid to drink it. Paul tried to maintain the impression of being interested, trying to stay engaged, to act respectfully ceremonious, but the phrase &#x201C;Poverty Tourism&#x201D; kept ringing in the back of his mind.Sitting in the back of three assembled rows of people was a mother and son. The son was a young man dressed in his smartest shirt and cleanest pants. The mother wore a bright green veil but Paul couldn&#x2019;t see her eyes; she refused to look at Paul, resolutely staring down. He got the sense that she did not understand much of the hoopla that was going on and probably felt a bit forced into the situation. They were sitting next to two other young men and two young women, all of whom were clearly model Grameen prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;s. Each person falteringly told a story of how Grameen had helped them, but it is the story of this mother and son that really stuck with Paul.Yunus&#xA0;began telling her story, explaining how she was illiterate and did not speak any English, but more importantly, she was consumed by her shame, hence the hanging of her head. She had been a beggar, abandoned by her husband at a very young age and forced to live on the street. One of her three young children had died. She was penniless and had no choice but to beg trawling from person to person for money to feed her children first and then herself. She had often feared that her other children might die.Eventually, after hearing about it through a local community network, she had asked for and been granted a Grameen Bank &#x201C;Struggler&#x201D; Loan. She explained that they are called &#x201C;Struggler Loans&#x201D; and not &#x201C;Beggar Loans&#x201D; for a reason: because everyone is struggling, some more than others. The loan she took out was the equivalent of $12. With that money, she bought a cow; Grameen&#x2019;s <em>16 Decisions</em> philosophy dictates that any money loaned not only goes towards purchases, but more importantly, towards changing a person&#x2019;s life fundamentally. Although she only earned a small amount of money with the cow she was able to repay her loan plus the accumulated interest. Horrified to learn that they charged a street-beggar interest, Paul later discovered that interest was in itself a form of dignity, that everyone, whatever their circumstances, is taken seriously as a customer and charged accordingly.After many years, she bought another cow. Following another of the <em>16 Decisions</em>, Yunus had to put a child through school as part of Grameen&#x2019;s explicit written social contract that the money was to be &#x201C;invested&#x201D; somehow in the borrower&#x2019;s future. Her future was her son. For years and years she struggled to put him through school, and eventually he was accepted to a university in Bangladesh. And, he had just graduated from college at the top ten percent of his class with a degree in mathematics.After Yunus spoke, Paul went up to the mother and son. She looked up tentatively through her veil as Paul asked her son for his contact information. Paul said to him: &#x201C;Your mother must be so proud of you.&#x201D; &#x201C;No Sir,&#x201D; he replied without a moment&#x2019;s hesitation, &#x201C;I am so proud of my mother.&#x201D;Why did Paul tell me this story? He&#xA0;learned two things from that trip. First, that it&#x2019;s so rare in life we get to see for ourselves the first-hand impact of the things that we do, but when we do, it&#x2019;s truly powerful. To truly connect, even if it&#x2019;s through one person and their story, speaks volumes over any number of anonymous statistics and pie charts. Paul has read countless books and white papers on micro-finance and its effects, but seeing the impact on one family convinced him a million times more than reading about it in print.Secondly, Paul learned an important lesson about the function of business. A successful business is not about transaction, it is about meaning. It is about empathy, morality and humility. It is not about the quantity of big bold interactions, but the quality of small, intimate ones. Grameen happens to be a bank, but it is operating from a place of higher purpose, to elevate the lives of its customers. As Paul said, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not a bank, it&#x2019;s a dignity-engine.&#x201D;<strong>UNCOMMON SENSE OBSERVATIONS</strong><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Envision a room full of college students at a top university who have won a competition. Add to that image the prize they&#x2019;ve earned: highly-coveted slots in an experimental immersion course designed to transform their entrepreneurial ideas into enterprises.Then picture all of their startup businesses&#x2014;from an energy drink to a new 3D printing technology to a green motorcycle to a fire damage mitigation software system&#x2014;facing the ultimate challenge as declared by the teaching team: prove that there is a market for your concept within the next 10 weeks.<a href=\"http://steveblank.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Blank</a> is the guru behind <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/course/ep245\" target=\"_blank\">this methodology</a> and thought leader behind the curriculum these startups used as their instruction manual this summer. According to Steve, uncovering a customer need will not come from within the halls of most MBA programs where spreadsheets, marketing textbooks, theoretical competitive analyses, and traditional customer research rule. Instead, as the principles of the Lean Startup course suggest, the answers can only come from learning to hear what customers really value. Real customers. Live customers. Outside of the classroom. Beyond the four walls of an office. Far from the world of online surveys. Actual, in-the-flesh encounters and cold calls with people who you expect to rally to support your business.I was lucky enough to witness the gradual evolution of nine student teams from doubters to devotees as they experienced the two Cardinal Rules of entrepreneurial success as part of the <a href=\"http://kellercenter.princeton.edu/elab/\" target=\"_blank\">eLab at Princeton University</a> this summer. Cardinal Rule #1: Get out of the building. Cardinal Rule #2: Being smart begins with being dumb.<span>It used to be that we&#x2019;d guess what our customers would buy using one of three methods:</span>1. Build it and hope they come (like the Model-T Fords rolling off assembly lines or Steve Jobs bringing us &#x201C;disruptive technology&#x201D; that we didn&#x2019;t crave until it appeared).2. Forecast what might happen when we go to market. (Like a guess with more numbers attached.)3. Pray.It actually turns out that a lot of technology and techniques that were supposed to refine our thinking about what customers wanted were simply fancier ways of doing one or all of the above. In the old days, we&#x2019;d focus a lot on trying to predict our customers&#x2019; behavior before we went to market.But, the real genius in uncovering customer demand comes from approaching the potential customer with a good dose of na&#xEF;vet&#xE9; combined with expert skills in keeping our preconceptions out of the picture. Being smart comes from being a little dumb. Instead of predicting or praying, we can apply the science of being na&#xEF;ve to listen closely for evidence that customers care about what we have to offer.Consider the smart approach versus the dumb approach in these customer scenarios that are all designed to uncover customer demand for a new product:Interviewer (&#x201C;smart&#x201D;): Don&#x2019;t you love the antioxidants in our bottled tea?<br> Interviewer (&#x201C;dumb&#x201D;): Tell me about all of the drinks you&#x2019;ve had this week.Interviewer (&#x201C;smart&#x201D;): If you could have a motorcycle that had great gas mileage and was better for the environment than traditional motorcycles, how much would you be willing to pay?<br> Interviewer (&#x201C;dumb&#x201D;): Tell me about your commute to and from work and where you drive on the weekends.Interviewer (&#x201C;smart&#x201D;): When you create patterns at your foundry, would you prefer to use the newer technology like 3D printing?<br> Interviewer (&#x201C;dumb&#x201D;): What are some of the things your foundry&#x2019;s customers care about when you&#x2019;re bidding a job for them?There&#x2019;s a lot we can learn from training ourselves to be dumb (and humble and observant)&#x2026;-We can learn that firemen might not be able to pay for fire safety software but that the insurance companies who protect buildings can.-We can learn that it&#x2019;s not the 3D printer that customers care about (how the sausage is made) but the speed and accuracy of the parts that come off the assembly line (the sausage) that wows them.-We can learn that putting an electric motorcycle into the trunk of a Tesla might be a great way to get people to try a new commuting option.One of the eLab students described his &#x201C;Eureka!&#x201D; moment about the value of being dumb: &#x201C;I thought that having a great answer was the way to solve the entrepreneurial puzzle, but the magic comes from having a great question. And, being very quiet when the customer starts to talk.&#x201D;How many times have we stepped on a customer&#x2019;s punch line just when he&#x2019;s about to reveal the solution to our entrepreneurial struggle? How many times have we been dumb for the long run by acting smart in the short run? What are our customers dying to tell us? What can we do to find out?<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"&#x201C;When I grow up, I want to be a follower,&#x201D; said no one. No kid aspires to follow others. No employee says his best quality is being a follower. No MBA student signs up for followership classes (and not just because business schools don&#x2019;t offer them.) Being a leader is what counts these days. Leadership is rewarded. Leaders are glorified. A leadership role is the ultimate goal. A Google search for leadership produces 353,000,000 results. Followership&#x2014; 9,100,000 &#x2014; less than 3%. And yet, a leader needs followers; a good leader needs lots of good followers. So what makes a good follower?Merriam-Webster defines followership as &#x201C;the capacity or willingness to follow a leader.&#x201D; Wikipedia says it&#x2019;s &#x201C;the actions of someone in a subordinate role.&#x201D; Neither of these seem to capture that followership is a skill &#x2014; and just like any other skill, it can be trained and developed. If you want to be good at followership, you have to work at it. There is an art of followership and it involves at least three things:&#x201C;Disagree and commit.&#x201D; One of the &#x201C;leadership&#x201D; principles that the folks at Amazon embrace is &#x201C;disagree and commit.&#x201D; CEO Jeff Bezos wrote about it in his Letter to Shareholders this year: &#x201C;If you have conviction on a particular direction even though there&#x2019;s no consensus, it&#x2019;s helpful to say, &#x2018;Look, I know we disagree on this but will you gamble with me on it? Disagree and commit?.&apos;&#x201D; He says this is one of the ways the company keeps its &#x201C;decision-making velocity&#x201D; high. It&#x2019;s how Amazon leaders practice the art of followership.&#x201C;Disagree and commit&#x201D; is the natural posture of a good follower. He shares his point of view with the leader but if they disagree and the leader insists on her way, he commits to going along with it. He doesn&#x2019;t agree and then complain; he doesn&#x2019;t agree and then goes around telling other people he&#x2019;s right; he doesn&#x2019;t agree and then try to do it his way anyway. He commits to the course of action.Excellence. Just as leaders must do their jobs with excellence, followers must too. Followers must be reliable &#x2014; a good follower demonstrates that her leader can depend on her to do the job well. They must be able to work independently &#x2014; a good follower doesn&#x2019;t need detailed instruction or constant supervision. They must be trustworthy &#x2014; a good follower doesn&#x2019;t leak information or talk about the leader or the work inappropriately. And they must be self-motivated &#x2014; a good follower doesn&#x2019;t require the spotlight. They do a good job even if no one notices, which is often the case.<br>Care for the team and the leader. Professional hiking groups usually include two &#x201C;lead&#x201D; positions: a guide and a sweep. The guide leads the way, clearing the path, setting the pace, and navigating the group to its destination. The sweep hikes last in the group and plays just as critical role. The sweep is responsible for keeping a count of the hikers, watching for injuries, etc. and making sure the pace is appropriate for everyone. As the literal and ultimate follower, the sweep cares for the team and helps them be successful. And he cares for the leader and helps her know when adjustments are necessary. It&#x2019;s no different in the business world &#x2014; leaders need sweeps to ensure their teams get to their destination.Far too few people practice the art of followership. It requires humility and self-confidence &#x2014; people who get their identity from the esteem of others will probably have a hard time being followers. Followership also requires discipline &#x2014; people with natural leadership gifts have to learn to resist the urge to jump in and start leading. Above all, it requires clarity &#x2014; clearly knowing when it&#x2019;s time to follow. Thomas Paine once said, &#x201C;Lead, follow, or get out of the way.&#x201D; People must know the role they need to play.Followership a gift &#x2014; the best gift someone can give to a leader, and everyone should give it.&#xA0;Original post: <a href=\"http://deniseleeyohn.com/the-unsung-art-of-followership/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DeniseLeeYohn.com</a><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"As children we learn to say &quot;please&quot; and &quot;thank you&quot;, but as businesspeople we don&apos;t use these words as often as we should. Perhaps our manners get lost in our busyness. Or more likely, the hierarchy between customer and service provider, or between manager and employee, leads to a sense of privilege and lack of graciousness.Whatever the reason, a greater sense of gratitude is needed in our business interactions. <strong>We can practice thankfulness if we cultivate humility, caring, and love in our relationships the way three extraordinary leaders do.&#xA0;</strong>As the CEO of <a href=\"http://www.pirch.com\">PIRCH</a>, the home appliance chain that sells $10,000 in-home saunas and $20,000 Viking ranges, Jeffery Sears needs to exude confidence&#x2014;and yet he is one of the most humble business leaders you&apos;ll ever meet.He explained to me how he tries to put himself in his customers&apos; shoes, &quot;You have no idea what&apos;s going on in somebody&apos;s life when they walk through your door. They could have found out that their child has cancer. They could have found out that their parents are ill. They could have found out that their husband&apos;s been cheating on them or vice versa. You just don&apos;t know what&apos;s going on in somebody&apos;s life, so the gift we could give to our guests is nothing more than we&apos;re going to make this the best possible moment of your day, that&apos;s our job.&quot;This type of empathy and deference can only come from a genuine sense of humility&#x2014;and it leads to sincere gratitude. Sears has been known to stay up until 4:00am after an event writing thank you notes to every attendee. He even sent me a handwritten thank you after I interviewed him for my blog.For Carl Sewell, Chairman of <a href=\"http://www.sewell.com\">Sewell Automotive Companies</a>, one of the largest and longest-standing car dealership organizations in Texas, &quot;genuinely caring&quot; isn&apos;t just words in his company&apos;s mission statement&#x2014;they&apos;re words to live by. He truly cares for his customers.Carl and his team are renown for going well out of their way to help their customers&#x2014; showing up at midnight to open a customer&apos;s car that they&apos;re locked out of and not charging for the service; driving a car from Dallas to New York for a customer who didn&apos;t want to rent a car there; or recognizing a customer stranded with a flat tire on the side of the highway and spontaneously pulling over to help. Sewell explains in his best-selling book, <em>Customers for Life</em>, why he and his employees give their personal phone numbers to customers, &quot;We want people to call us, no matter what time it is. They&apos;re our customers, and we want to take care of them.&quot;<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref\">[i]</a>His genuine caring leads to generous thankfulness&#x2014;both from his customers <em>and</em> his employees. Sewell writes, &quot;Have you thanked your employees today? If you thank customers, you should also thank the folks who do the work.&quot; He expresses his gratitude to his employees in many ways, including throwing thank-you barbecues&#x2014;on company time. &quot;If you are going to throw a party to say thanks,&quot; he says, &quot;Why not have it begin at 3pm on a Wednesday instead of Sunday at 2pm? It shows people you are serious about your appreciation.&quot;And then there&apos;s Cheryl Bachelder, CEO of fast food chain <a href=\"http://popeyes.com\">Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen</a>, who led her organization through a major turnaround by tapping an unusual source&#x2014;love. Faced with declining customer traffic, sales, and profits in 2008, Bachelder and her team decided that out of all the stakeholders in their business&#x2014;including guests, employees, shareholders and board members&#x2014;they would focus on their franchise operators.Popeyes made a deliberate decision to do more than simply try to make their franchisees happy. They were going to <em>love</em> them. &#x201C;It was a game-changing notion&#x2014;to love the people you lead... We would love them for their passion. We would love them enough to listen to their point of view and their business experience.&#x201D; Bachelder said.She writes about how Popeyes&#x2019; love for their franchisees is related to their gratitude for the commitment they&apos;ve made to the company, &quot;They are risk takers&#x2014;willing to bet their lives and bank accounts on Popeyes. We are grateful.&quot;As these leaders demonstrate, thankfulness is a critical posture to assume in business. But it&apos;s not something one can manufacture or fake. It&apos;s a fruit planted in the seeds of humility, caring, and love.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Watson Sr., the traditional founder of IBM, is well known for his corporation&#x2019;s century-old, one-word imperative. Desk placards, wall posters and overhead signs instructed employees to THINK. THINK was imprinted on custom leather notepads, notebooks and briefcases. The external corporate magazine that the world associated with IBM for decades carried the brand THINK, and on the cover of its first issue was The Thinker by Rodin. This one-word message was translated into every language conceivable, and eventually, analysts, customers and cartoonists considered it synonymous with IBM.<br><br> Yet, history has forgotten that Watson Sr. only used THINK to stage an ACT. During the Great Depression he needed to increase the probability that action would follow thought. To encourage such actions he took a unique approach. On February 21, 1930, he told his executive team that &#x201C;If a man thinks about his work&#x2014;if he puts real thought into everything he does&#x2014;he should be and will be forgiven for the mistakes he makes.&#x201D; On October 29, 1930&#x2014;a year to the day after Black Tuesday crushed the New York Stock Market&#x2014;he told a room full of new employees to &#x201C;Think before you act, and then if you make a mistake you will be forgiven.&#x201D; This was Watson Sr.&#x2019;s formula for success: THINK and ACT, and don&#x2019;t make the same mistake twice.<br><br> Robert H. Davis, a reporter for the New York Sun, saw this formula for success a few years later hanging overhead as he entered the reception area of IBM&#x2019;s International Headquarters in New York City. He wrote of his impression standing there looking up.<br> THINK! Directly opposite was the luminous and inspiring phrase: <strong>We Forgive Thoughtful Mistakes!</strong> After reading the lines of these two laconic declarations no man of the IBM payroll can come to any conclusion other than that Tom Watson wishes to instill, namely: Put your mind on the job, express your convictions; make errors occasionally; hit a rock and remember where it was located in your path. And on the next trip sail onward to your anchorage.<br> During the Great Depression, Watson Sr. did not have the capital to invest in his culture. Instead, he invested his time; he maintained a constant focus; and he delivered a consistent, memorable and superlative message. But IBM would eventually reach a point beyond which it could not grow with the &#x201C;old man&#x201D; at the helm. It was not in this leader&#x2019;s nature to delegate truly important decisions. As the traditional founder of IBM, he found it impossible&#x2014;like so many entrepreneurs&#x2014;to completely let go. All major decisions of thought and action still flowed through his corner office. When Watson Sr. died in 1956, Watson Jr. faced a decision. His father was one of the world&#x2019;s most recognized corporate, philanthropic and humanitarian figures. His father counseled presidents, walked with kings and queens, and every employee knew what this lone figure had accomplished for their company, their country and their fellow man. The easy route would have been to continue along his father&#x2019;s well-proven path. The son, though, was not like his father. Although&#x2014;like his father&#x2014;he loved the company, he did not wish to live for it. In 1956, following his father&#x2019;s death and now IBM&#x2019;s Chief Executive Officer, he acted. He spurred growth by removing one significant barrier: a corner office that needed to be involved in major decisions. He wanted everyone to have the same destination but allow them the freedom, in their unique situations, to determine the best path forward. So he called a meeting in historic Williamsburg, Virginia&#x2014;because he meant it to carry the aura of a constitutional convention&#x2014;and started building his IBM.<br><br> To encourage independent thought, embolden individual action and enable decentralized decisions, he founded a guiding corporate constitution on three words: Respect for the Individual, Service to the Customer, and the Pursuit of Excellence.<br> <br> At the time, analysts, shareholders, employees and customers alike wondered if the son could fill the father&#x2019;s shoes. In 1956, after forty years under Watson Sr., IBM employment stood at 56,000, net income at $56 million and revenue at $500 million. Rather than taking another four decades to match those numbers, Watson Jr. added, on average, 56,000 employees every four years, $500 million in revenue almost every year, and $56 million in additional net income every nine months. When Watson Jr. stepped down as CEO fifteen years later, revenue per employee had grown by 212%, net income per employee by 310% and the number of stockholders by more than 2,000%. Under his watch, IBM became the corporation his father had always envisioned. Watson Jr. didn&#x2019;t fill his father&#x2019;s shoes, he manufactured a new pair that was more comfortable. <br><br>Tom Watson Jr. fully unleashed a power source that his father only partially tapped: the human potential.<br><br> Encourage people to think. Embolden and decentralize action. Forgive thoughtful mistakes.<br><br> Allow others to find their own anchorage. And just let go.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"While the news, and the rest of the world has moved on, the people of Japan are still deep in the challenges of dealing with restoration efforts. When&#xA0;the devastating disaster struck Japan in March of this year we&#xA0;felt compelled to do our part to help the people of Japan in whatever way we could.We have a long-standing relationship with World Vision and being firm believers in their humanitarian efforts, we turned to them to see what they were doing in Japan.&#xA0;Right after the earthquake hit,&#xA0;World Vision deployed an assessment team to northern&#xA0;Japan&#xA0;from Tokyo led by a Japanese emergency response manager with experience in Haiti, Pakistan, Myanmar and the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. This team reached the city of Sendai within 48 hours of the quake and Fukushima shortly after, and they immediately began coordinating with local government officials and partner organizations to determine how to start relief operations to support children and their families.&#xA0;The funds they were raising were&#xA0;used to fund the distribution of relief supplies and the construction of &#x201C;Child-Friendly Spaces&#x201D; that offer psycho-social support for children affected by disasters, allowing them to resume normal childhood activities and experience structure and security that are often lost during emergency situations.Next we got together with our friends at Jedidiah Clothing, a humanitarian apparel brand also headquartered in San Diego, and combined our design skills with their manufacturing and distribution channels to develop the &#x201C;Help Heal Japan&#x201D; shirt. We kept it simple&#x2013;for every $20 T-shirt sale, we donated $15 to World Vision&#x2019;s Japan Relief Fund.The campaign reached even greater success than we could have hoped. Nordstrom picked up the line to carry inside each of their locations nationwide and more than 20 other retailers joined them. Our collection with Jedidiah was featured in multiple media outlets including&#xA0;Women&#x2019;s Wear Daily, Antenna Magazine, GOOD Magazine, the&#xA0;Los Angeles Times&#xA0;and even&#xA0;Vogue Mexico. In just two weeks, the collection raised more than $43,000, at which point World Vision announced that they had raised all of the money they needed, to the tune of $10 million, and were no longer accepting donations for Japan.Following our model of Uncommon Sense, we used our design thinking, partnerships and good communication to move quickly to develop a program to raise additional dollars that would aid in the restoration and repair of Japan.<strong>UNCOMMON SENSE OBSERVATIONS</strong><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"So here&#x2019;s what went down: You went into the office, all fired up for the big meeting. You pitched that great idea that popped into your brain last month and have been working on non-stop ever since. The thing is, though, that it didn&#x2019;t really turn out the way you&#x2019;d imagined it. The audience didn&#x2019;t smile all the way through. Their faces didn&#x2019;t change from quizzical to delighted to beaming. The ovation at the end was polite, but not rousing. Oh, and it was a long, <em>long</em> way from &#x201C;standing&#x201D;.And the questions! You didn&#x2019;t really plan for questions, did you? Not apart from &#x201C;How did you think of such a brilliant idea?&#x201D; Instead, people were questioning each and every one of your assumptions. They doubted that key parts of the idea would be accepted by the users. THEY ASKED WHAT WAS TRULY NOVEL ABOUT IT! Bastards. That&#x2019;s what you get for working in an uncreative organization&#x2026;OK, now hold that thought. I&#x2019;m willing to bet that if you&#x2019;re reading this, you&#x2019;re the kind of person that can relate to the story above. You might even have lived through it, and thus feel entitled to calling your organization any number of not-so-nice names. Well, time for some reality therapy. You&#x2019;re wrong, dead wrong. Sure, your organization may lack a certain <em>je ne sais quoi</em> in the innovation department, but the story above isn&#x2019;t proof of it. On the contrary.Most every organization bemoans their lack of ideas, yet they are often overflowing with and positively awash in ideas. The problem is that the same organizations that are bursting with ideas great and small are at the same time preternaturally good at killing these same ideas.You see, the story at the start wasn&#x2019;t about organizations killing ideas, but the very opposite of that. What that story was about was critique, about people listening to your idea and engaging with the same, about them asking follow-up questions, inviting you to argue for your idea. That&#x2019;s not a bad thing. That&#x2019;s an <em>excellent</em>&#xA0;thing. That&#x2019;s the best thing ever.<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/hiddenloop/202150091/sizes/m/\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5380\" title=\"Image_2\" src=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Image_2.jpg\" alt width=\"395\" height=\"500\"></a>Many organizations <em>do</em> get creativity wrong a lot of the time. Most of the time, even. Far too many think that creativity is all about sunshine and lollipops, and perversely think that a creative environment is one where people are constantly smiling and where every idea is met with high-fives and applause. But this isn&#x2019;t the hallmark of a creative organization at all. In fact, I think it sounds an awful lot like hell.The real measure of a creative culture is not that it&#x2019;s exceptionally uncritical and populated by Prozac-drones. <strong><em>The real measure of a creative culture is that it cares about ideas, and sometimes criticism is a beautiful way to show that you care.</em></strong>Think back to the original story once more. What is the <em>worst</em> response you could have received? Think about the possibility of you giving a passionate talk, presenting your idea and then&#x2026; nothing. Just blank stares. A barely masked yawn. A shrug of the shoulders, and that&#x2019;s all she wrote. Worse than questions? You betcha. Guess what? There&#x2019;s another version of that silence. That&#x2019;s the version where everyone listens, smiles, even applauds. But still remain mostly silent. Say things like &#x201C;Nice!&#x201D; or &#x201C;Yeah.&#x201D; or &#x201C;Love that.&#x201D; Where someone ends the whole thing by saying &#x201C;Well, you&#x2019;ve given us lots to think about.&#x201D; That, my friend, is indifference in disguise.You think questions are bad? Questions are wonderful! And <strong><em>critique is amazing!</em></strong> They&#x2019;re both proof that people are prepared to engage with your idea, that they respect you and your thinking enough to connect with it, that they&#x2019;re willing to take your idea through a trial of fire&#x2014;as that&#x2019;s what you do when you want something to develop and grow. <strong><em>The most creative organizations aren&#x2019;t the ones that applaud every idea, but the ones that respect ideas enough to challenge and critique them.</em></strong>The very best creative organizations understand, on a deep, cultural level, that respect for ideas means engaging with them, and that engagement isn&#x2019;t just pats on the back or cheerful smiles. They understand that asking questions is a way of saying &#x201C;I see you, fellow dreamer, as worthy of my attention.&#x201D; They understand that creativity flows from friction&#x2014;not just passively nodding along to each and every idea&#x2014;and from pushing budding ideas towards something greater. They scoff at the people who think that creativity is best captured in one of those sad brainstorming affairs where &#x201C;every idea is wonderful&#x201D; and questions are banished. They build a culture of forceful, natural critique, filled with individuals who can both dish it out and take it in turn, who cherish the engagement that is the hallmark of truly creative cultures.So your idea got trashed at the meeting? Good. I&#x2019;m happy for you, and I hope you remembered to say &#x201C;Thank you.&#x201D; You were given a gift, although you might have missed it. Your colleagues showed that they&#x2019;d listened. They challenged you to let you shine. They showed your idea love by trying to help it be all it can be, and they invited you in to the real dance of creativity; a dance where you get to flex your muscles, go beyond your comfort zone, step up and fight for your idea. Both you and the idea got a chance to become something bigger and better than you were before the meeting. You both had the best day ever.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

No. Perhaps we can consider a variation on the golden rule; treat others they way THEY want to be treated.<br><br><strong>Modernize everything (not just technology)</strong> <br>Warning! The Industrial Revolution is over and organizations that continue to operate with that mindset will suffer, and probably die. Henry Ford is a well-known successful American Industrial Revolution leader credited with this quote, &#x201C;Why is it every time I ask for a pair of hands, they come with a brain attached?&#x201D; The leadership and management styles made popular by the construction and manufacturing industries of more than 100 years ago must transform and adjust to the varying needs of people today. How often do organizations that want to innovate purchase expensive and exciting new technology but use old school autocratic methods to implement the changes? Seventy percent of the time these implementations fail or are forced on staff in a ham-fisted manner, which creates unhappy, unproductive and disengaged employees. Not to mention a failed change project, wasted resources and a rapid return to the status quo.<br><strong>Stop talking about the culture</strong> <br>Harvard Business Review writer, John Traphagan states, &#x201C;Corporations and other organizations do not have cultures; they have philosophies and ideologies that form a process in which there is a constant discourse about the nature and expression of values, beliefs, practices, ideas, and goals.&#x201D; As a consultant and speaker, I have been guilty of the typical 1980&#x2019;s discussion of company culture, but am now beginning to change that tired discourse to something more relatable and real. Organizations are made up of people, and people have personalities, varied expertise and experiences, and different needs. An organization that has been around for a decent amount of time will also have employees of different ages. Do they all wish to be treated the same?<br><br><strong>Promote Congruency<br></strong>Well done to businesses and organizations who have a mission statement and corresponding values. This is an important strategy when promoting a shared vision. Do management and leadership behaviors match the mission and values? If providing an excellent customer experience is one of the values, then every customer-facing employee must have a great deal of decision-making authority. However, when a customer complains, the representative is often instructed to quote policy because he or she has no power to make adjustments in order to meet the customer&#x2019;s needs. If, in writing, the organization values employee creativity, but stifles it with inflexible rules and structures, those lovely vision statements become meaningless. Other examples of incongruent messages involve autonomy versus dependence, purpose versus insignificance, and mastery versus inefficiency.<br><br><strong>Treat others the way they want to be treated<br></strong>Of course it takes more time and effort to figure out how each individual really wants to be treated, and it&#x2019;s much easier and more comfortable to continue to operate in the familiarity of the Industrial Age. Leaders who begin to wake up from the unconscious comfort created by years of robot-style management behavior and do the labor-intensive work of establishing trust and building relationships with their people, are taking a step toward reviving an unhealthy and dying organization. Is treating others they way they want to be treated easy? No. Is it the answer? Yes.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

This article is a bit different from those that we usually share. But it&#x2019;s uncommon and it&#x2019;s important because we&#x2019;re all leaders&#x2014;whether we&#x2019;re leading a company or family or anything else. Like parenting, effective leadership can be practiced and mastered. And at the core of that learning should be leadership principles&#x2013;a guiding set of values that provide a clear map for navigating through virtually any leadership moment.<strong>The most important quality of a good leader is to empower those you lead to do their best.<br></strong>Two parents have an uncommonly real and thoughtful conversation about helping their children make the transition from dependence to self-sustaining adulthood. <em>&#x201C;We stumble and fall every day.&#x201D; &#x201C;Character comes before credentials.&#x201D;</em> Nebraska Sen. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenSasse\" target=\"_blank\">Ben Sasse</a> and his wife Melissa are chock-full of uncommon sense and so are the leadership principles that they live and lead by.These five simple, principles are applicable to many of the challenges we see companies and brands face daily. These foundational principles aren&#x2019;t just inspirational words to hang on the wall, but actionable values. Values that live on a wall in a conference room are often lengthy and forgettable, but shared values that are alive and authentic drive conviction, consistency and clarity. Like children with no real guidance, companies with unclear values give no clear guardrails for choices. But values-driven companies function with passion and focus.&#xA0;<strong>We are what we do and companies are what their people do.<br></strong>Actions reflect what people truly hold important. Most people and organizations have a gap between the beliefs they aspire to and the beliefs they actively act upon. Shared values that are demonstrated in choices and behaviors from a company create opportunities to engage and inspire people inside and outside of the organization. <a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/meaningful-values-lead-to-valuable-actions\" target=\"_blank\">Values connect and motivate people, and can supercharge teams with energy and commitment in tough times.</a> They are the lifeblood of a culture and are what brings a company to life. <em>Do you know your company and brand values? Have you shared the values your company lives by? </em>Examine your values and what you believe in, make them meaningful, then put them to work inside and outside of your company.<strong>Being a great leader isn&apos;t about motivational words. It&apos;s about real action.<br></strong>Leaders must be able to inspire, challenge and engage people to believe that they can put their principles into practice. Just like a good parent, they know how to ask the right questions and when to challenge problem-solving. And as Ben and Melissa reiterate, effective leadership means you don&#x2019;t need to have all of the answers. So what should we expect from a leader?&#x2014;Bulldog Drummond&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/what-should-we-expect-from-a-leader\" target=\"_blank\">CEO discusses the basic skills</a> required to live the definition of a leader.&#xA0;<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

But as they get older, they lose that magical openness, and for many, the door to creativity closes very early. It starts in elementary school when the need to fit in comes from peers and parents, to get the grades and tick the boxes. Taking risks and asking <em>why</em> becomes less important than knowing the answer and conforming. In a world where ticking boxes is rewarded, we&#x2019;re not encouraging people to come to work with that passionate childlike curiosity because it&#x2019;s not encouraged in our education system.Many corporate cultures program their employees to think that they have to have all of the answers. This leads to breeding know-it-alls who must have all the answers, and through position or posture create confusion, and waste time and valuable resources because they don&#x2019;t really know what they&#x2019;re talking about.<strong>Wake up stupid<br></strong>Many come to work ready to compete for attention and credit rather than to learn and be inspired by those who are more experienced. But kids wake up every morning with an open mind, living like a sponge for knowledge, approaching every project, every challenge or interaction with an &#x201C;I know-nothing-teach-me&#x201D; attitude. We can learn a lot from how kids operate. Go to work with an open mind and childlike curiosity that helps you see things that you&#x2019;d otherwise be closed to. Embrace being the dumb one in the room; it opens the mind and leads to great conversations and fresh new ideas.<strong><em>Why</em></strong><strong> is a powerful learning tool <br></strong>Approach every situation and every business challenge with a learning mindset. Put &#x201C;why&#x201D; to work by challenging convention and existing solutions with questions that help you gain knowledge and understanding. Use the power of &#x201C;why&#x201D; in all aspects of your work (and in relationships for that matter) for clarity on the objectives, reason for a project, and observational learning around consumer behavior.&#xA0;If you don&#x2019;t know or you don&#x2019;t understand why your team or the company is going down a certain path, don&#x2019;t sit there as an uninformed passenger, ask &#x201C;<em>why?</em>&#x201D;!&#xA0;Here are some things you might consider questioning this week:<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"&#x201C;Well, we didn&#x2019;t get dressed up for nothing.&#x201D; Hamish Braveheart &#xA0;&#xA0;A simple statement and reminder of<em>, I committed to this, I wanted to do this. I prepared for this. Now let&#x2019;s go do this.</em>As I sat atop of the snow-packed mountain that looked similar to a death wish, I repeated, &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t get dressed up for nothing.&#x201D; And, I stood up and slid down the kiddy slope at the ski resort with all the grace of a baby giraffe trying to walk for the first time. For my many years of outdoor pursuits, I had never been on skis or a snowboard. I was venturing into a world I knew almost nothing about and couldn&#x2019;t be more thrilled with the journey. A journey that was much more than learning to snowboard, but a defining moment of discovery and commitment.<strong>Embrace the journey as a beginner</strong>Fascinated and inspired by the learning process I was reminded that operating from a novice perspective is powerful. As a non-scientist who jumped head first into a very scientific field, I had the opportunity to operate as an unbiased newcomer and learn nearly everything from the ground up. That novice approach forced me to learn in a way different than others with an education in the field. Keeping a novice sense of wonder and curiosity continues to be extremely valuable for me even today. Returning to that state of mind, the snow was a reminder to keep the lessons of a beginner close. Learning to snowboard took me back to the early stages of my career and how the powerful lessons of learning should be remembered at every phase.<strong>Set yourself up for success</strong>Carving down a mountain involves a lot of preparation and a proper learning environment. Before embarking on my journey, I watched videos and asked plenty of questions. I spent seven hours walking up and sliding down the bunny slope, followed by a full day practicing toeside and heelside regular and switch under the watchful eyes of my experienced friends. I carefully built a foundation to learn. Had I gone strait to the top and flung myself down the mountain, I likely would have hated it. By building the skill slowly and allowing the learning process to progress, I was able to enjoy the journey of learning. Building the skills necessary, and hitting successful milestones along the way, builds confidence and the ability to achieve success.<strong>A little dose of laughter</strong>Falling hurts, but hurts a lot less with a smile on your face and willingness to laugh at yourself. Failing at anything sucks&#x2014;even more so when it sends snow up your jacket. But, there&#x2019;s no point in taking something so seriously that you can&#x2019;t see the humor in a little slip. Keeping in mind how a beginner&#x2019;s mistake can be funny and being able to admit failures is a constructive way to move forward and persevere.<strong>The gap in what you may think is relatable</strong>If at first something seems just like another action or problem be careful before assuming the two are the same. I spent the first few days after my snowboarding experience relating it to surfing. Indeed they are quite similar, but there are distinct differences in how you control the two boards. In surfing, the majority of control comes from the rear of the board&#x2014;not so in snowboarding where far more weight must be on the front leg. This misunderstanding caused me some unfortunate tumbles. Relying on what you know can be the folly when undertaking something new, but it can also be a mistake when you are more experienced. Remember to validate what you know in the real world before assuming one challenge is similar to another.<strong>Admit what you&#x2019;re not good at</strong>Learning requires a healthy sense of awareness to concede that you don&#x2019;t know everything&#x2014;and no one expects a novice to. As I loaded onto my first chairlift, I turned to my liftmates and declared, &#x201C;I haven&#x2019;t done this before so lookout. And my apologies in advance.&#x201D; They laughed and said it wasn&#x2019;t a problem; they&#x2019;d all been there. They coached me through it and let me exit first while watching to give me plenty of space and limited anxiety about running into anyone. They were congratulatory when I finished without any harm to myself, and more importantly, anyone else. It&#x2019;s a reminder of how at some point we are all new at something. By simply acknowledging that I was new and unaware, I was able to work with others&#x2019; support through the process. There is no reason to be embarrassed of a novice status; every expert has been there.<strong>Get cozy with uncertainty</strong>Trying something new can be unsettling. As a novice snowboarder, everything on the mountain was new&#x2014;from how to put on boots to the silence on the lift. Every morning and every run I had to remind myself that it was new was going to be a challenge. Training and preparing yourself to be comfortable with discomfort is a key part of learning. The uncertainty also means discovery and opportunity. Preparing your senses, and especially your head, to mentally go to a place of <em>this may be awkward but that&#x2019;s okay</em> prepares you to learn and grow.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"It was August 2011 when I met <a href=\"http://www.scarson45.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Scars on 45</a>, a young British band which was coming to perform a free show in the Bay Area. To be honest, I&#x2019;d never heard of them. The name alone didn&#x2019;t inspire much personal curiosity. In fact, it reminded me of a truly awful novelty mix hit by a Dutch act called Stars on 45, which topped the UK charts in the early &#x2018;80s. As it turned out, the proximity between the bands&#x2019; names was a total coincidence&#x2014;the five members of Scars on 45 hadn&#x2019;t even been born yet! The band was actually named after a term used by Emmylou Harris when describing how she treated her father&#x2019;s record collection when she was an infant.I saw the band play at a free concert hosted by the radio station where I present my own show every week, <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/KRSH-UK-with-Davy/182463321779580\" target=\"_blank\">KRSH UK</a>, and they were great. They had folks from 6 to 60 years old dancing throughout their set and they&#x2019;re not even a dance band. They&#x2019;re an alternative band, a fraction reminiscent of Coldplay or Elbow. But to make such comparisons would probably be unjust.After issuing a couple of EPs, Scars&#x2019; self-titled debut was released in the U.S. on April 12<sup>th</sup> of this year to critical acclaim. It was declared the 7<sup>th</sup> best album of the year to date within Amazon&#x2019;s &#x201C;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=5417975011\" target=\"_blank\">50 Best Albums of the Year</a>&#x201D; and produced an AAA hit, &#x201C;Give Me Something&#x201D;. Upon release, the album wasn&#x2019;t initially a huge commercial hit, but it is a truly fine piece of work that still has huge potential if exposed to the right market.Last month, I was fortunate enough to work with them on my radio show. My friend offered me the use of his recording studio and we invited Scars to come and record an exclusive session for the station. They arrived and immediately got down to business, playing three great songs and a cover by The Cure, all in about 2 or 3 hours.They shocked me that day&#x2014;not because of the fine music, but because of their unprecedented determination and work ethic. It turned out that Scars On 45 had been on the road in America since before we&#x2019;d met the previous year. Out of a staggering 15 months of touring in a tiny van, they&#x2019;d been home to see their wives, families and loved ones for only 9 weeks.I&#x2019;ve met hundreds of bands and have rarely heard of such amazing dedication. I asked them where they&#x2019;d been based and the answer was &#x201C;nowhere apart from the van and super-budget hotels.&#x201D; From coast to coast, in a foreign country, for 15 months.Even though music sales have stabilized over the past year, it&#x2019;s unbelievably hard for a band, especially one from overseas, to get any sort of break&#x2014;labels are rarely prepared to invest in supporting bands on the road, work visas for bands can be expensive and very hard to obtain, and there are a million fledging bands out there as competition, many with muscle behind them. But Scars has worked hard to cut through the clutter, through pure courage and conviction.There&#x2019;s not a hint of rock arrogance in this band&#x2019;s ranks. These young Yorkshire-born musicians actively decided to promote themselves in the States, as opposed to their native land however long it takes. Unlike nearly every band I&#x2019;ve known, they are a true David in Goliath&#x2019;s homeland, and are slinging rocks at conventional music industry wisdom like no other. But how, and why?First and foremost, they have a DIY plan. It&#x2019;s not radical, and if anything, it&#x2019;s old school&#x2014;playing absolutely anywhere they can, visiting every radio station that will have them, being prepared to sleep rough, and live on micro budgets for food and drink. Not for 6 weeks at a time, but for over 60 weeks to date.They also have no apparent ego. They know where they stand in music&#x2019;s pecking order and have never wavered in their determination to be successful. Not only are they open to any opportunities, but unlike many other acts, they recognize that they don&#x2019;t know it all and are open to learning from mistakes, professionals and most importantly, their fans.In addition to touring, they have incorporated the use of social media. With no major label behind them, they have amassed a huge fan base through their own personal and constant efforts on Twitter and Facebook&#x2014;mostly from the back of the van.They also sell their own merchandise, standing behind a merchandise table after the shows as many bands do, but also by going out into the audience, engaging fans personally and selling their swag one-on-one.From The Fray and Ingrid Michaelson to the Doobie Brothers, Scars on 45 will play with any other act. They just want to be out there doing what every band should be doing&#x2014; playing live nearly every day, and cultivating a following through passion and self-belief.Through this determination, they were recently rewarded with one of the most coveted TV spots for bands that are usually reserved for the big guns&#x2014;a live performance on &#x201C;The Tonight Show With Jay Leno&#x201D;. It&#x2019;s been a peak in their career to date, and has led to corporate shows, private events, and many music placements in high profile TV shows such as &#x201C;One Tree Hill&#x201D; and &#x201C;Grey&#x2019;s Anatomy&#x201D;.It&#x2019;s paying off, but there&#x2019;s no slouching. They&#x2019;ve started to validate their dedicated approach to success and their conviction lives on, now more than ever. This is a special band with a near-unique work ethic, deep determination, and genuine courage from which we can all learn.

       "content_body":"Business innovation is much more than investing in a new SaaS, hiring edgy employees or toying with new ideas. It is a deep, long-term project that produces structural changes within your company. At its heart, innovation is about changes observed through the passage of time. And if you&#x2019;ve ever dove head first into an innovation project you&#x2019;ve probably discovered that while business innovation is exhilarating, it is also difficult. Generating new ideas requires tools, process exploration, the ability to condense big data into insights and a plan for action.Design Thinking is an innovation tool that allows you to delve deep into your stakeholder&#x2019;s world and offer them products or services that they don&#x2019;t even know they want or need. But to get to that stage you need to lay the groundwork.<strong>Mind Mapping for Deep Insight</strong>I start the Design Thinking process by assessing what is&#x2014;who the customers are, what they think of the product or service prototypes, and what resources there are for further development. This exploratory stage helps identify data that needs to be translated into useful insights to help fuel the business. Mind mapping is a tool that helps distill a huge amount of data into information and insights to be easily communicated. It&#x2019;s a great alternative to PowerPoints, spreadsheets and charts.Design Thinking mind mapping captures and represents the minds of the customer. This means you need to enlist your customers help to truly gain deep insights. If you want to get the best results, all stakeholders need to be involved in the mind mapping process&#x2014;this includes colleagues (you need them on the same page about the challenge the company is facing). Mind mapping creates meaningful data and allows patterns to emerge that might otherwise be missed.<strong>Mind Mapping Exercise</strong>&#xA0;The mind map is now complete; you&#x2019;ve made the switch from <em>what is</em> to <em>what if</em> in the design thinking process&#x2014;which are the conditions that design solutions must satisfy to solve customer problems.I&#x2019;m always interested to hear about the ways businesses are using Design Thinking for Business Innovation&#x2013;let&#x2019;s discuss on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vanessaincolour?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "principle":"BE THE BRAND",
       "content_body":"We live in an age where nearly perfect, ubiquitous information allows buyers to accurately predict the experience and quality of products and services. People today rely less on cues or promises of quality (like brand names) and more on the opinions of experts and other consumers. People no longer need a familiar name and logo, a creative advertising campaign, or an attractive message to help them decide which product to buy. The influence of brands on purchase decisions seems to have diminished.But this doesn&#x2019;t mean that brands have become less important&#x2014;ask the executives at Starbucks, IBM, Apple or IKEA. The brands at these companies remain integral to their success because they develop and use their brands as more than mere signals of quality. These and other similar great brands conceive their brands differently. They use their brands as management tools to fuel, align, and guide everything they do.Brand building looks very different the way great brands do it.<strong>Priority target group: internal, before external</strong><br> Great brands start building on the inside. They first engage the people who work on the brand before turning their attention to those they hope will buy it. They know that employees and other internal stakeholders must understand and embrace the brand before they can be expected to appropriately interpret and reinforce it to customers. Whether defining a brand from the very beginning or re-invigorating or re-directing a misguided one, brand-building is first an internal task.<strong>Driver of differentiation: purpose, more than promotion or products</strong><br> Great brands distinguish themselves through more than discounts and clever promotions. They know that special pricing can serve as an attention-getter, but discounts rarely sustain customers&#x2019; interest once the promotional period is over, and they rarely build brand equity. Similarly, they know that when it comes to brand differentiation, marketing campaigns, sponsorships, and other promotional activities are best viewed as a means to an end&#x2014;not the end itself.The purpose of the organization provides a more effective source of differentiation because it is more meaningful and more sustainable. Now that customers can see through to companies&#x2019; inner workings, <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> companies do things has become as important as <em>what</em> they do. And, given that companies no longer sustain a monopoly on features or technology, they must differentiate on something other than products alone.<strong>Manifestation: culture, then communications<br> </strong>Organizational culture is the primary way great brands are manifested. Employees&#x2019; attitudes, actions, and daily decision-making speak volumes about a company&#x2019;s true nature and the value it seeks to create for customers. With great brands, the defining brand values and attributes are experienced and expounded by the people working inside the company well before they are expressed to people outside.<strong>Success metric: integrity, not impact alone</strong><br> Brands can no longer declare success when they manage to make a splash in the marketplace. Awareness and attention are no longer the most valuable social currency in today&#x2019;s information-intense environment&#x2014;trust and affinity are. So great brands emphasize brand integrity and root out the gaps between their brand promises and customer reality. They measure themselves by whether or not what they actually do aligns with what they claim to do, because they know that&#x2019;s how customers measure them.<strong>Leadership: management, not marketing</strong><br> Ultimately, great brands know that the new demands on brands require responsibility for stewarding and guiding their brands at the highest levels of their organizations. Brand-building must shift from a silo function to enterprise-wide orchestration, with company leaders setting direction and facilitating implementation across all operations and all stakeholders. Great brands have elevated brand-building from a niche marketing responsibility to the core driver of their business.When you think about and build your brand the way great brands do, your commitment is not to <em>express</em> your brand&#x2014;it is to <em>embody</em> it. You understand the most important way to address the new information landscape is to BE THE BRAND.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"<u>Be More</u> by Todd Putman is a narrative of stories and life challenges of people, encouraging each of us to find our own truth. It&#x2019;s a book for anyone who struggles to answer the question: What do you want to be when you grow up? Because no matter how old, and regardless of life accomplishments, it&#x2019;s a question we all need to be able to answer.The central idea behind the book is simple really, <em>be more</em>. Almost everyone wants more out of life. But until we can articulate exactly what that means, it&#x2019;s very difficult to get there.&#xA0;<u>Be More</u> provides&#xA0;practical direction&#xA0;in the form of the Skills, Values, Passion (SVP) exercise to help people better understand their innate gifts, and what matters most to them, as tools to&#xA0;articulate what they really want from life.&#xA0;The book was inspired by the many career-centered conversations Putman has had through the years. He found that there are so many people who are incredibly smart and talented but aren&apos;t able to articulate their dreams. They know they want more but can&apos;t say what that means, and as a result have no clear path for success The result is a colossal waste of potential&#x2013;potential for good, for innovation, for change, for value creation and more. That waste is what drove Putman to take action.The book doesn&#x2019;t fit into a traditional self-help book category. Though the fundamental concepts aren&apos;t new, I found that <u>Be More</u> is practical and helpful&#xA0;guidance. It doesn&apos;t stop at the broadest strokes and it doesn&apos;t make grand pronouncements and then leave&#xA0;readers in the weeds.&#xA0;There are a lot of books out there that encourage people to follow their passions, but <u>Be More</u> challenges soul-searching that goes a step deeper. It offers straightforward direction to get to the answers&#xA0;and then explains what to do next to <em>be more</em>. The book is&#xA0;engaging and accessible while simultaneously in-your-face and ass-kicking.My top six takeaways:<u>Be More</u> is necessary for individual exploration.

What is it about the beginning of a new year that creates such widespread movement to do better? Of course, part of it is due to the annual tradition of making New Year&#x2019;s resolutions. But where did this tradition come from in the first place?<strong>Novelty shakes things up<br></strong>According to <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/user/bob-nease\">Dr. Bob Nease</a>&#x2019;s article in <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3061366/your-most-productive-self/your-brain-is-on-autopilot-more-than-you-think-heres-how-to-wake-i\">Fast Company</a>, the recognition of a new start allows our brain to temporarily shift out of autopilot and into a mode of conscious evaluating and decision-making. In the midst of a new beginning, we are alerted to available decisions that we would usually have made subconsciously and without recognizing that a choice was made at all.<strong>Turn off cruise control and drive<br></strong>The thing is, we are wired for autopilot because it is adaptive. If we had to concentrate on the millions (yes, millions) of little decisions we make every day, our brains would be completely overloaded with information and we would never be able to survive&#x2014;let alone get anything done. However, we are so efficient at minimizing our conscious decision-making that all too often we get swept up in our routines and fail to recognize that we actually have the opportunity to regularly make other choices&#x2014;not just on the first of the year.<strong>Shift gears<br></strong>A fresh start is powerful because it alerts our brain of a shift. The part of our brain that is devoted to conscious decision-making fires up for action when we notice something novel or something that contradicts our expectations (like the fresh start of a new year). According to Dr. Nease, &#x201C;It seems that there&#x2019;s a natural tendency to pause and reflect at the start of any new time period.&#x201D; So, it&#x2019;s not just on the first of January when we see this effect&#x2014;it also applies to the first day of the month and to the first day of the week as well. But, it doesn&#x2019;t have to stop there.&#xA0;<strong>Don&#x2019;t wait around&#x2014;break your routine now<br></strong>We can tap into this higher level of consciousness&#x2014;not in some sort of lofty spiritual sense but in a very real neurological sense&#x2014;by creating small new beginnings for ourselves throughout the year, month, week and even day. Dr. Nease even suggests we build distinct breaks in our routines so that we have little fresh starts sprinkled into our days. By harnessing novelty&#x2019;s power to awaken our brain to the power of choice, we have the ability to create little starts for ourselves constantly. Because there is an art in the start&#x2014;and we don&#x2019;t have to wait till the beginning the next year to find it.<br><br> For more tips on how to break out of autopilot and give yourself little starts, check out this <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3063834/take-control-of-your-decisions-by-conquering-your-brains-autopilot?utm_content=buffer0b8f1&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\" target=\"_blank\">video</a>.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

Like imagining an iPod in the days of the Sony Walkman.<a href=\"https://www.statefarm.com\" target=\"_blank\">State Farm</a> has recently designed a pilot <a href=\"https://www.nextdoorchi.com/\" target=\"_blank\">experiment</a> called &#x201C;<a href=\"https://www.nextdoorchi.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Next Door</a>&#x201D; that is designed to do exactly that: Next Door attempts to offer a new generation of customers an insurance brand they can relate to. Their approach demonstrates the three basic steps for discovering new ideas that will strengthen our brands and build customer loyalty.<strong>1. Start with a hunch.<br></strong>State Farm noticed something very troubling a few years ago. Younger prospective customers, &#x201C;Millennials&#x201D;, weren&#x2019;t acting like younger versions of their parents. Causes and effects that had been linked decades earlier weren&#x2019;t working the same way they used to&#x2014;for instance, having a baby no longer automatically led to buying insurance. Millennials didn&#x2019;t sign up with agents the way their parents had. State Farm saw the trend and realized that their future depended on their ability to figure out what young professionals want from an insurance company.<strong>2. Walk a mile in your customers&#x2019; shoes.<br></strong>The State Farm team heard early rumblings in informal conversations that the Millennial customers had a hard time relating to all of the traditional financial services brands, from banks to insurance brokers to financial planners. According to Brett Myers with State Farm, a team of researchers followed dozens of customers around for days, from bank to brokerage firm to agency, to discover what it would take for a financial services firm to resonate with younger consumers.&#xA0;This is what they heard:<em>That couch in the bank lobby&#x2014;it&#x2019;s not for me.</em><em>I don&#x2019;t want a hard sell every time I ask for information.</em><em>I&#x2019;m stressed about my student loans, but I don&#x2019;t think they can relate to my situation.</em><em>I wonder what other people my age are doing about insurance.</em>State Farm was onto something: discomfort with traditional approaches and traditional brick and mortar settings + huge desire for information &#x2013; sales pitch + peer coaching = huge opportunity<strong>3. Imagine what might be.<br></strong>The research team learned that in addition to the existing live and online options for financial services, Millennials want a live place to gather for information immersion, informal coaching, and impromptu seminars.And voil&#xE0;&#x2014;State Farm&#x2019;s Next Door was born&#x2014;an experimental design (currently being tested in Chicago) for a novel, neighborhood hangout that allows people to experience their brand without sales pressure. Next Door offers a place where people share financial information, hold informal coaching sessions, and experience a whole new relationship with an insurance company. It&#x2019;s branded as State Farm, but insurance is not sold there.State Farm saw the signs of a risky future and designed a counter-intuitive concept to fix it that is based on research and walking in the shoes of their customers. Just at the time when many companies have abandoned their brick and mortar locations, Next Door represents a new place for Millennials to warm up to the State Farm brand.Customers couldn&#x2019;t tell State Farm what to do, but they did give State Farm signs and signals for what to try next.<strong>What hunch do you have today about your customers&#x2019; changing needs? If you walk a mile in your customers&#x2019; shoes today, how could you change your company&#x2019;s future?</strong><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

Grove argued that he believed fervently in the value of paranoia. He felt that leaders must never allow themselves to get comfortable, no matter how successful they had become. They had to devise ways to dial up their curiosity, to learn, to stay connected to the competition, to customers, to people who were willing to challenge the conventional wisdom.If you&#x2019;ve been in a role for any length of time, chances are you&#x2019;ve fallen in to some unhelpful routines and habits. Familiarity usually breeds complacency and before you know it, you&#x2019;re operating for large parts of your day on auto-pilot. You become blind to new opportunities, threats and chances to evolve and improve.In my last role at an innovation agency, one of our core values was &#x2018;Freshness&#x2019;. The act of constantly seeking out fresh new experiences in order to stimulate and energise our thinking. We used to encourage it in ourselves, in our teams, and as an agency. When we worked with clients, all our techniques were designed to help them think about their challenge, business model, or customer base in fresh new ways.As an English rugby fan, I&#x2019;m always fascinated by their coaching style. Despite their recent dip in results, much of their past success can be laid at the coach, <a href=\"https://www.uppingyourelvis.com/article/emulating-the-eddie-jones-england-rugby-leadership-style\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Eddie Jones</a>&#x2019; door. At 57, having accumulated <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2018/02/03/chris-robshaw-eddie-jones-isthe-best-man-manager-have-ever-met/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">23 years of coaching</a> experience in which he has won a World Cup, Tri-Nations, Six Nations titles, and enjoying over a 90% success rate, Jones&#x2019;s thirst for knowledge remains stronger than ever. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pep Guardiola</a>, the Orica-Bike Exchange Tour de France outfit and the coaches of the England football, cricket and women&#x2019;s hockey teams are just a few of the resources that Jones has called upon since his appointment as England head coach. <em>&#x201C;I try to meet people who are smarter than me,&#x201D;</em> says Jones.He&#x2019;s been described as a shark, because he has to keep moving, in his quest to improve.Because he leads by example it means he can then demand it of his coaching staff and players. As a result, nobody rests on their laurels, egos can&#x2019;t inflate and everyone is constantly alert and alive to new opportunities, even when the chips are down.The English football team saw a change in the attitudes of the players for the World Cup 2018. The ego-driven, complacent, burdened by history and expectation demeanor was replaced by a team who displayed humility and &#x2019;played with lightness and joy&#x2019;. This new thinking has been accredited to Manager Gareth Southgate (who spent time with Eddie Jones) but also to their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/10/psychology-england-football-team-change-your-life-pippa-grange\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new team psychologist</a>, Pippa Grange, who spent time building trust amongst the team &#x2018;making them closer, with a better understanding of each other&#x2019;. Embracing failure, emotion and empathy. The difference with the training for this World Cup is that the psychological sessions were not optional, as they had been previously. Southgate looked for fresh ideas and took a punt with a new strategy, which paid off. They may not have made the final but they impressed the nation ten-fold.<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/steve-jobs/8811892/Steve-Jobs-in-his-own-words.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Steve Jobs once said</a>, <em>&quot;We don&#x2019;t get a chance to do that many things, and everyone should be really excellent.

So, this is what we&#x2019;ve chosen to do with our life.&quot;</em>If you&#x2019;re going to do something, strive to be excellent at it. To be excellent you need to possess a growth mindset, where you&#x2019;re always open to new approaches and methods.

       "content_body":"Great leaders inspire, and by their very presence, create confidence and the belief that anything is possible&#x2014;no matter the prevailing&#xA0;conditions. Whether you lead a nation, a&#xA0;company, a sports team or any&#xA0;other group of people, the qualities, characteristics and&#xA0;skills required to lead effectively are&#xA0;very similar. So as you look at where you are on the ladder of leadership&#x2014;at the top, in the middle or just putting one foot on the rungs&#x2014;here are the basic skills required to live the definition of a leader.<strong><br></strong><strong><br></strong><strong>Great leaders cast a compelling vision for the change they expect to see in the world and for the future.</strong> They lay out a clear purpose for the organization and then set the context for the business with a clear and compelling strategy. Great leaders help to nurture the individual and institutional belief that anything is possible, and they effectively harness the collective capability and skills of the group to achieve results. <strong><br><br></strong><strong>Respect, honesty and accountability are the positive ingredients for building a culture of trust.</strong> Fear, caution and self-preservation are just a few symptoms of organizational dysfunction that fester and slowly undermine the full potential of an organization when trust is absent. Leaders must&#xA0;operate with the highest degree of integrity, authenticity and consistency to model behaviors that inspire and guide their teams. This only happens when a leader&#x2019;s actions and decisions are guided by a clear set of actionable values that the entire organization can operate within.&#xA0;<strong>&#x201C;Purpose affirms trust, trust affirms purpose, and together they forge individuals into a working team,&#x201D;</strong> according to General Stanley McChrystal who is best known for his command of&#xA0;Joint Special Operations Command&#xA0;(JSOC) in the mid 2000s. Great leaders believe in the value of every individual on their team, understanding what motivates each and guiding them to be their individual best. A leader understands the challenge of competition and knows that winning is paramount. The two keys to a team operating at a maximum level is having accountability for the mission and collaboratively working to exceed expectations. According to McChrystal, &#x201C;The temptation to lead as a chess master, controlling each move of the&#xA0;organization, must give way to an approach as a gardener, enabling rather than&#xA0;directing. A gardening approach to leadership is anything but passive. The leader&#xA0;acts as an &#x2018;Eyes-On, Hands-Off&#x2019; enabler who creates and maintains an ecosystem&#xA0;in which the organization operates.&#x201D;&#xA0;<strong>Great leaders are part coach, part communicator and part motivator, always in service of the team they lead. </strong>It&#x2019;s never about them, but rather, it&#x2019;s about the people they serve. Great leaders are empathetic and highly in tune with the needs of their teams and the environments in which they are operating. They work in service of their team to solve problems, providing the needed resources and the environment where people can thrive and do their best work. Great leaders demonstrate a genuine concern for the people in their care (employees, consumers and shareholders), while instilling a sense that anything is&#xA0;possible for both the individual and the broader enterprise they lead.<strong>Leaders must be able to inspire, challenge and engage people to believe that they can define and achieve their potential.</strong> Leaders are great listeners who don&#x2019;t feel like they need to have all of the answers, nor have all of the plays figured out. They know how to ask the right questions and when to challenge their teams to think through solutions to the answers.We should demand nothing less than exceptional from our leaders&#x2014; whether it be from leaders of companies or countries. To lead is a privilege, not a right. We should expect thier best each and every day, because our lives are connected to it.&#xA0;<em><a href=\"http://bulldogdrummond.com/blog/author/shawn-parr#filters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more from Shawn Parr</a>.</em><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

And <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/06/180627155634.htm\"><span class=\"s2\">a staggering 59%</span></a> said that their employer doesn&apos;t provide sufficient mental health resources. </span><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Empathetic leaders create healthy teams and contribute to organizational health.</strong></span><span class=\"s1\">Maintaining a high-pressure work environment in order to drive financial success may be seen appropriate in order to motivate employees to perform more but, the stress it creates over time often leads to disengagement and loss of efficiency. The American Psychological Association (APA) 2017 &#x201C;<a href=\"https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2017/state-nation.pdf\"><span class=\"s2\">State of our Nation</span></a>&#x201D; shows that 61% percent of Americans reported &#x201C;work&#x201D; as a common stressor.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&#xA0; </span>An earlier APA report in 2015 estimated that more than $500 billion was spent from the U.S. economy because of workplace stress, and 550 million workdays were lost each year due to stress on the job.</span><span class=\"s1\">Further research have shown that experiences with demeaning people&#xA0;damage decision-making skills, creativity, and productivity. According to <a href=\"https://www.businessolver.com/who-we-are/news/businessolver-finds-workplaces-still-lack-empathy\"><span class=\"s2\">Businessolver</span></a> 77% of employees would work more hours and 60% would take a pay cut to work for a more empathetic employer. This is particularly critical to Millennials; an earlier report shows that nearly&#xA0;80%say they would change jobs if their employer became less empathetic, while 66%&#xA0;of Baby Boomers stated the same. Leaders must make sure that they are not part of the problem. They must practice empathy no matter what levels they have reached, as the mistreatment of employees is not a path to success. It is actually the opposite and does affect a company&#x2019;s brand overtime. <br></span><span class=\"s1\">Change requires self-evaluation. Be part of the solution not, the problem. </span><span class=\"s1\"><strong>A leader&#x2019;s job is to build-up not, create havoc.</strong></span><span class=\"s1\">There are many reasons why the spread of inadequate behavior persist in leadership. These include relentless demands that overburdens leaders and employees alike. Hidden behind &#x201C;the cloud&#x201D; &#x2014;emails, social media have replaced in most cases the in-person interactions and empathy that comes about through face-to-face contact. Courtesy should be celebrated widely for personal and professional success. </span><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Think differently and recognize bad habits.</strong></span><span class=\"s1\">Don&#x2019;t underestimate the severity and negative impact of your shortcomings. Self-evaluation for change can be intricate but, taking the steps to pinpoint the habits and hangups that drive actions in both personal and professional relationships is the first step to address flaws and biases. We are all predisposed to be unduly positive about our self-images and to at times ignore unfavorable details about ourselves. Although companies may not always be able to control some of the factors that influence their leaders&#x2019; behaviors; they can try to promote some of the following:</span><span class=\"s1\">Personal or professional&#x2014;always place the needs of those around you above your own. Practice civility and think of others first&#x2014;most of all.</span><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Given their relatively high website traffic and access to point-of-sale data, DTC brands have more opportunity to drive on-site personalization at all stages of the consumer journey. While non-DTC brands face inherent challenges around identifying their consumers, there are opportunities to learn from the site personalization and live chat tools of their DTC counterparts.For example, Dollar Shave Club&#x2019;s site provides one of the most seamless DTC experiences in <a href=\"https://www.l2inc.com/research/personal-care-2018\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gartner L2&#x2019;s Digital IQ Index: Personal Care</a>.&#xA0; It&#x2019;s personalized, pushing new visitors to trial from the homepage, while presenting returning visitors with product recommendations based on user preferences. The site also highlights new product lines and incorporates innovative basket-building features like a persistent toggle that filters for bundles on category pages. In the face of declining user acquisition and retention, the brand targets visitors registering for an account without an active subscription by displaying a homepage with a Customize Your Club diagnostic tool, serving as another opportunity for explicit data capture. Once the quiz is completed, the homepage is populated with relevant product recommendations based on inputs like &#x201C;because you have sensitive skin.&#x201D;Both Dollar Shave Club and Honest Company have also invested in live chat to drive acquisition and retention on site. They both include persistent live chat, but use the feature differently. Honest&#x2019;s live chat is oriented toward consumer acquisition, personalizing prompts based on where the consumer sits on-site. For example, when you browse bundle product pages, Honest&#x2019;s live chat pops up asking &#x201C;Do you have any questions about bundles?&#x201D; In contrast, Dollar Shave Club focuses live chat on current subscribers via personalization by tying previous chat transcripts to users&#x2019; email addresses, enabling agents and customers to reference past questions and conversations with ease.<br><br>For DTC and subscription brands, personalization continues to become table stakes, driving site traffic for both new and existing consumers. Even without access to the same level of consumer data via purchase history, non-DTC brands can still learn to personalize on-site experiences based on past browsing behavior or account features to create unique guided shopping experiences targeted towards customer acquisition and retention.&#xA0;Original post by&#xA0;<em>Alizah Farooqi on</em>&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.l2inc.com/daily-insights/what-you-can-learn-from-dtc-brands?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=daily-insights-blog&amp;utm_campaign=email\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GartnerL2.</a>&#xA0;<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "principle":"ARE YOU FOR REAL?",
       "content_body":"Brand authenticity has become a topic of many business conversations because customers are now equipped with the tools and information to discern whether a brand is in fact what it says it is&#x2014;and they place their brand loyalties and make their purchase decisions accordingly. In the past two weeks I&#x2019;ve been in three separate client meetings in which someone expressed the desire for their brand to be known as authentic. One executive wanted to include authenticity in its core brand essence statement and another chose the descriptor in a brand personality attribute exercise. The president of the third company wanted to claim authenticity as a key brand differentiator. Each brand is authentic in some way, but I found myself repeatedly explaining that authenticity is something you <em>do</em>, not something you <em>claim.</em> People will think your brand is authentic if you actually behave in authentic ways.Here are three Uncommon Sense ways to encourage your brand to be authentic:<strong>Deliver on your promises. </strong>Keeping promises is the number one way brands demonstrate authenticity. Many brands make promises by setting high expectations in their advertising and promotions, but they disappoint people by not delivering on those expectations in their customer experiences. Fast food chains are notorious for using beautiful images of food that look nothing like the real product; airlines depict their attendants as shiny, happy people despite most of them being overworked and underappreciated; technology firms make bold claims about product superiority or capabilities that are only achieved with perfect user-conditions. These types of disconnects will discredit any brand claim of authenticity. Before you set expectations, be sure you can deliver on them. Your brand can&#x2019;t just be a promise; it must be a promise delivered.<strong>Don&#x2019;t try to be something you&#x2019;re not.</strong>The temptation to imitate the successful practices of other brands or the fear of missing out on the latest trend often causes brands to stray from their core positioning and identity. When you do something off-brand, for example create a partnership with a brand that doesn&#x2019;t share your values, use channels or pricing that puts your brand out of reach of its fanbase, or offer a product that&#x2019;s geared towards customers outside your usual target, you confuse, and potentially alienate, people. But when you use the core of your brand as a filter to decide what to do and what not to do, you are acting like an authentic brand. Brands that are clear about what they stand for and stay committed to their original vision earn people&#x2019;s trust.<strong>Execute consistently in every way, every day. &#xA0;</strong>Authentic brands know that everything they do creates a brand impression. Every interaction matters and every touchpoint communicates. They ensure that they execute on their brand values and express their brand personality in everything they do. If you want to exhibit authenticity, everyone who works on your brand&#x2014;from senior executives to line employees&#x2014;must appropriately interpret and reinforce it. Brand authenticity doesn&#x2019;t function like a battery that still operates when it&#x2019;s half full of power&#x2014;it&#x2019;s like a light switch that&#x2019;s either on or off. You&#x2019;ll build perceptions of authenticity by executing consistently 100% of the time, not swinging for the fences and batting 100.Authenticity, and similar brand descriptors like integrity and trustworthy, often land on the pages of brand strategy decks because they&#x2019;re worthy aspirations. But it&#x2019;s more appropriate to bake them into operational plans and processes, and cultivate them within culture and values. Just like &#x201C;cool&#x201D; and &#x201C;fun&#x201D;, if a brand wants to be authentic, it must <em>be</em> it, not <em>say</em> it.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"I&#x2019;m fascinated by the different types of people I meet in the business world and the way that their personalities show up in what they do.&#xA0;I&#x2019;m drawn to people who have a quiet inner confidence that is expressed in their interactions and their output. I am comforted by their sense of self. They know who they are and they operate with a kindness of spirit that makes shared time and conversation pleasant. They exude confident energy to everyone they come into contact with.Matthew Larson is the Chief of Product Design for <a href=\"http://www.matuse.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Matuse</a>, one of the surf industry&#x2019;s most exciting new brands that designs incredible, high-end wetsuits. Matt is a soft-spoken, kind-spirited design thinker who is passionate about surfing and technology. Through the following ten ideas, you&#x2019;ll learn how Matt has combined his love for surfing and design while building a company he loves.<strong>1. PAY ATTENTION, YOUR NEXT MOVE MIGHT BE ON THE END OF YOUR NOSE<br> </strong>As the Chief of Product Design at Matuse, Matt Larson still works at the iconic surf shop, Mitch&#x2019;s in La Jolla. Matuse was born, like many world-class brands, by observing and understanding consumer needs and circumstance. Over time,&#xA0;Matt noticed a trend. Customers wanted more from their products and wanted to be educated about what they were purchasing. The average surfer was becoming increasingly demanding about technology. When customers walked into the store for a new wetsuit, they were bombarded with fanciful neologisms that tried to create excitement for the product. What they didn&#x2019;t get was the science behind the wetsuit&#x2014;what&#x2019;s on the inside, what&#x2019;s keeping them warm, what exactly is that $450 dollar suit? This is where Matuse was born.Working at Mitch&#x2019;s is an invaluable asset for Matuse and for Matt as the line of products is sold at both Mitch&#x2019;s locations. Working on the floor, Matt is the eyes and ears of Matuse and understands what the customers are saying, thinking and experiencing with his products. Being immersed in the retail environment is a free education if you take the time to observe and listen to what people want. All of the information to create solutions is right in front of him.Matt&#x2019;s personal inspiration for starting Matuse was to make a difference, to contribute and to leave a mark to improve the industry in which he was raised. He told me he wants people to get as excited as he does about the ocean and the science and passion that goes into Matuse&#x2019;s products.<strong>2. SURROUND YOURSELF WITH SMART PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT SKILLS<br> </strong>Matuse was founded by three partners &#x2013; John Vincent Campbell, CEO, John&#x2019;s father and Matuse Chairman, John B. Campbell, and Matthew, Chief of Product Design.Matt met John at Mitch&#x2019;s. John, who came from the advertising industry, was working on a textile project and had a material he was interested in selling to the surf industry. John was looking for anyone who might know something about wetsuits. That&#x2019;s when they first met and the magic happened. Matuse&#x2019;s genesis is special for Matt and he says that there are people in your life you meet for a reason.<strong>3. TAKE TIME TO DESIGN YOUR BUSINESS<br> </strong>Matt and John met many times to talk about philosophy, art, design, culture and affinities they had for other great companies. Over this time they thoughtfully created the foundations for Matuse. They created a brand pyramid, which helped them to delve deeper into their concept of a company with human traits. They took time to think, create, plan and build a company that the surf industry had never seen before.<strong>4. LET THE CHALLENGES OF BUSINESS BOND YOU<br> </strong>Matt loves what he does and believes that when you start a business you need to have that passion to get through all of the long hours and stress. At the end of the day, loving what you do is essential. His business partner is now one of his closest friends and he describes the people he works with at Matuse as family. They hustle and sweat the details together and, in doing so, have become incredibly close.<strong>5. STICK WITH IT. THERE&#x2019;S ALWAYS A LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL.<br> </strong>Matuse&#x2019;s biggest challenge was starting a company focused on an unapologetically high-end market in a down economy. Matuse delivered its first products late summer of 2006&#x2014;shortly after that the economy started its nosedive. That aside, the team at Matuse has worked intelligently and looked for the best retail partners to help deliver their message and be their ambassadors of &#x201C;ichiban&#x201D; (Japanese for &#x201C;number one; the best&#x201D;). They had to dig deep and stay focused, and are now seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. Their product line, which started with three pieces, is now close to forty. I predict that Matuse will grow into one of surf&#x2019;s most admired and successful brands in the years to come.<strong>6. BEAT TO A DIFFERENT DRUM<br> </strong>Matuse has developed the cr&#xE8;me de la cr&#xE8;me of limestone rubber with the Yamamoto Corporation from Osaka, Japan. They call it &#x201C;Geoprene&#x201D;, a titanium-coated, limestone-based rubber that is not only functionally superior (it&#x2019;s warmer, lighter, dries faster and lasts longer), but it&#x2019;s also more sustainable and kinder to Mother Nature. Matuse&#x2019;s limestone Geoprene is 98% water impermeable compared to that of petroleum-based rubber, which is only 65%.Matt never refers to the company as &#x201C;Matuse Wetsuits&#x201D;. Instead, he&#x2019;d prefer Matuse to be thought of as a way of thinking for people who want the best and are passionate about quality products. When people look at the Matuse logo, Matt wants them to think of something that has been well thought-out and designed with intention. Their visual imagery is distinct and original. They purposefully avoid the surf ad clich&#xE9; of having a picture of a surfer riding a wave with a logo at the bottom. Instead, they feature their products in environments that evoke interest, with surroundings that are sophisticated and compelling. Some of the past photo shoots have taken place in a Russian bath house, a highrise office on Wall Street, and many other unexpected locations. When you look at a Matuse ad you need to spend time dissecting what&#x2019;s happening in the story.<strong>7. YOUR BRAND IS A PLEDGE<br> </strong>Matuse&#x2019;s definition of <em>brand</em> is that it&#x2019;s a &#x201C;pledge&#x201D; of sorts; an undertaking by the company to produce an expectation. Everyone is innately conscious or unconscious of branding. Large brands elicit certain emotions, thoughts and memories from the consumer, and this drives their decision to purchase or not purchase. While brand identity and advertising campaigns are visually important (especially in an industry like surfing which is built off of imagery and emotion), they&#x2019;re only effective if the brand can reinforce the original pledge. The pledge is a company&#x2019;s expectation for something to perform the way it should, to look a particular way, and to deliver on the trust a consumer invests. Matt believes companies don&#x2019;t become brands overnight, it takes years of delivering on the pledge.<strong>8. POWERFULLY EXPRESS YOUR VALUES<br> </strong>While some companies have mission statements or values and beliefs in a book, it didn&#x2019;t surprise me to learn that Matuse&#x2019;s values are summed up in the Matuse poem:Confident but humble<br> Savvy yet spiritual<br> Matuse represents an ongoing path to achieving the synergy of art + function<br> Nature and industry<br> Passion with method<br> The mission is to deliver Premium (the ichiban) game that&#x2019;s focused on the next level.<br> Leader of innovation.<br> Follower of compassion<br> Our logo is an ancient Taoist symbol;It signifies &#x201C;Heaven and Earth&#x201D;<br> Three solid lines for Heaven<br> Three broken lines for Earth.<br> Creativity connecting<br> Art and function<br> Concept to completionWe are Matuse.<strong>9. USE EVERYTHING YOU&#x2019;VE EVER BEEN TAUGHT<br> </strong>Matt believes every job you have as you grow through life goes with you to the next project, whether it&#x2019;s school, work, or creating art. Matt&#x2019;s prior experiences have helped him develop better interpersonal skills, organizational tools and also improved his multi-tasking abilities. Matt will tell you all his skills are in constant growth mode and he&#x2019;s an expert of none of them. He knows that to grow as a designer, he needs to avoid getting trapped by the idea that he knows anything in its entirety.<strong>10. STAY CURIOUS AND YOU&#x2019;LL STAY YOUNG FOREVER<br> </strong>At a young age, Matt&#x2019;s grandmother told him, &#x201C;If you stay curious, you will stay young forever.&#x201D; Grandma Aparico had amazing energy and fought cancer for more than 20 years with a smile on her face. When Matt found himself bored, she told him, &#x201C;We perceive things not as they are, but as we are.&#x201D; &#xA0;To Matt this meant there&#x2019;s plenty to do and that he was the one who needed to get it done. Matt listened, and today he&#x2019;s constantly investigating the world around him, looking for inspiration from Mother Nature and other stimuli found outside his front door.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"To look at the gleaming bays and classic cars and spotless uniforms at Absolute Perfection, you&#x2019;d never guess what it really takes to make car service seem so effortless. But shine a light into the shop at dawn on a Sunday and watch as the lucky boss plays catch up on the backlog, and you&#x2019;ll realize it&#x2019;s called work for a reason.It&#x2019;s strange to admit this: A few months ago I found myself partying on a Saturday night, surrounded by hookahs, ice-filled vodka slides, and blingy cars. The event wasn&#x2019;t held at an edgy club or an over-the-top designer home, but at my car mechanic&#x2019;s garage. Before you jump to the wrong conclusions, you must first know that I&#x2019;m not what you&#x2019;d consider a &#x201C;car person,&#x201D; and secondly, I barely knew the guy (he fixed my car, gave great car washes, and once let me park at his shop for free when I had a plane to catch). However, that wouldn&#x2019;t explain why I&#x2019;d spend my weekend at a party at his shop. For months since that soiree, I&#x2019;ve watched this entrepreneurial, neighborhood car repair shop gradually draw me into their circle, and wondering what they work on, day-in and day-out, to create a community of fans full of rabid enthusiasm for car care.From the outside, it all looked so easy&#x2014;successful downtown San Diegans drop off their prized vehicles for high-end detailing and white glove repair services, all run by a team that looks like they were chosen by Central Casting for professional demeanor and easy-on-the-eyes appearance. But I knew that behind the scenes there must be more to the story&#x2014;a lot of grit and perseverance. A lot of&#x2026; well, work.I sat down with Mario Herbelin-Canelas, the Founder&#xA0;and CEO of the shop <a href=\"http://apautospa.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Absolute Perfection (AP) Auto Services</a>, to hear about what had attracted him to starting his own company and the behind-the-scenes grit that challenged him. I wanted to see beyond the Bugattis, Maseratis, and Lamborghinis sitting in their shiny glory on AP&#x2019;s front lot (and Priuses, Audis, and Volkswagens in the bays), and learn Mario&#x2019;s story: &#x201C;What&#x2019;s the work behind the glittery brand called Absolute Perfection?&#x201D;Mario&#x2019;s history reads like the textbook case on tips for aspiring entrepreneurs. He started working when he was twelve, washing cars and delivering newspapers for a couple of years before an older brother passed down his auto detailing job to a 15-year old Mario. By the next year, Mario ran the shop and was bitten by the entrepreneurial bug. He went on to support himself through college with his own detailing business, which expanded into valet services, and ultimately his own full-service auto-spa.Mario is now 36, and has a lot to share about what it really takes to run a business that now employs more than 30 people, servicing a growing community of picky customers. The secret is that Mario still, despite his tremendous success, finds himself in a paint bay on Sunday at 6:30 AM to give ultra attention to a classic car or burning the midnight oil figuring out where to invest for his next growth opportunity. Over his 24+ years in the business, he&#x2019;s formulated a set of rules for entrepreneurs that I&#x2019;ll call <strong>Elbow Grease 101: The Insider&#x2019;s Guide to Work that Grows an Enterprise.</strong>1. <strong>Always call people back the same day.</strong><br> Whether it&#x2019;s good news or tough news; whether it&#x2019;s a long-time customer or a total stranger; always call them back. That is the core of Mario&#x2019;s work ethic (and how he was chosen for this profile&#x2014;he called me back). According to Mario, an entrepreneur&#x2019;s real reputation is built when they think no one is watching. He learned that people notice the little things and small symbolic gestures, like returning a call, can lead to the kind of trust that opens doors. &#x201C;I am lucky to be the auto specialist for all of Rolls Royce&#x2019;s auto shows and special events including the crown jewel of events, the <a href=\"http://www.seemonterey.com/events/sporting/concours/\" target=\"_blank\">Concours d&#x2019;Elegance</a> in Pebble Beach. That door opened because of a reputation for responsiveness that I guess I earned in small doses, even when it didn&#x2019;t look like anyone was keeping score.&#x201D;<strong>2. Sweat the stuff that looks like small stuff but is actually potentially big stuff.</strong> Reading contracts carefully and having a great CPA wouldn&#x2019;t seem like a top priority to an auto technician. But according to Mario, it&#x2019;s not enough to master his craft without deciphering the red tape. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been caught cross-wise in contracts that weren&#x2019;t iron-clad. &#xA0;The threat of potential lawsuits has led to sleepless nights. The difference between wannabes and entrepreneurs is the determination to pay attention to everything.&#x201D;<strong>3. Pray for setbacks.</strong><br> When Mario was in his twenties, he got lucky. He got squeezed out of a deal to sublease prime downtown real estate to open his own shop. It&#x2019;s a long story how Mario&#x2019;s trust was betrayed, but in his scrambling to find a new opportunity he linked up with a very seasoned businessman, Ramin Samimi, who became his mentor (see #5).<strong>4. Face a recession.<br> </strong>In 2008, his shop was on shaky ground when the recession hit, so Mario used that pressure as the kick in the pants he needed to expand from detailing to a more full-service auto service shop. He bit the bullet and finally took the training and courses he needed to get up to speed and expanded his business just when his competition was going under. &#x201C;I knew it was sink or swim, so didn&#x2019;t give myself a chance to let up the pressure.&#x201D;<strong>5. Have a great mentor.</strong><br> &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve got to admit there are parts of the job I literally hate. Like lying in bed at night realizing I&#x2019;m responsible for so many people&#x2019;s lives and futures. And all of the counseling it takes to keep employees engaged. And all of the moments when you&#x2019;re sitting at a table negotiating with lawyers and you can&#x2019;t lose your cool. I think back to scenes with my mentor, Ramin Samimi, who was always 100% respectful and calm&#x2014;no matter what. I force myself to bring patience and respect to every single interaction.&#x201D;Mario Herbelin-Canelas&#x2019;s rules should be posted on the wall of every auto shop and also passed around to anyone who&#x2019;s trying to build an enterprise. From my perspective, I judge every business I interact with now based on a new standard. Whether it&#x2019;s a teller at my bank, or the staff at my doctor&#x2019;s office or a clerk at a local appliance store, or even a major online retailer, I now wonder to myself if they&#x2019;d rise to the Mario standard for Absolute Perfection by asking, &#x201C;Would I show up to a hookah party hosted by this company?&#x201D;<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

And the absolute last thing you&#x2019;d envision would be a guy with the impish humor of a standup comedian like Conan O&#x2019;Brien, the iconic visionary voice of a Seth Godin-type of character, and the business savvy and bravery of a Richard Branson&#x2014;standing in the middle of his offices dressed in a wetsuit all set to head off on a cultural tour of his country&#x2019;s most innovative brands.<br><br>Meet Henrik Hyldgaard, author of the recently published book Hotel Creativity (yes that is the same as the name of his studio) and inventor of an original model for business: The Theory of Profitivity, based on the premise that creativity&#x2014;not simply analysis&#x2014;is what&#x2019;s been missing in every business&#x2019;s quest to drive profits. Inspired by this innovative theory, I flew out to Denmark to experience his ideas in action and interview him about his radical belief that business needs to view creativity as much more than a nice-to-have. According to Henrik, profits are stuck these days because we&#x2019;ve throttled, muzzled, and gagged our creativity.<br><br>Henrik is committed to changing all of that, and explained his obsession: &#x201C;The companies that thrive in today&#x2019;s fast-paced environment have learned that they have to maintain and expand their brands and business value every day. Profits used to come from staying the course. Today, it&#x2019;s all about keeping up with change. Creativity is the skill that everyone needs to master right now&#x2014;creativity is only path to profits. Everyone needs to &#x2018;go profitate&#x2019;.&#x201D;<br><br><strong>A Distinctly Danish Field Experience: Profitate or Die</strong> <br><br>From the minute I met Henrik, I saw the world of branding through a new lens. We went out together to experience &#x201C;profitivity&#x201D; in action, and visited a company that is proof of the power of the maxims of profitivity:<br><br>1. Design creativity into your culture as a &#x201C;must have&#x201D;.<br><br>2. Invent remarkable experiences for your customers to jolt people out of brand complacency.<br><br>3. Get the entire company into the act of responding to trends and improving on the buzz of your brand. Everyone from the CFO, CIO, HR leaders to the front line teams has to get on board.<br><br>4. Don&#x2019;t start with incremental thinking when you think of driving future profits. Start with new, more innovative questions like, &#x201C;What can we do to get our customers to love us?&#x201D;<br><br>Henrik wanted me to see how the Theory of Profitivity works, so he took me to visit Aarstiderne, a large organic farm outside of Copenhagen. Its founders started with an observation: families wanted to preserve the feeling of the family dinner table, even though their busy lifestyles made it hard to visit the market every day. By putting Profitivity (not merely pure profits) front and center in every aspect of their operations, they grew from a tiny team to what is now a thriving, complex business that delivers more than 35,000 meals per week throughout Denmark.<br><br>We walked onto the grounds of what felt like a Whole Foods Market transformed into a multi-acre farm with the buzz of Google headquarters. Everywhere you turned, you could see creativity front and center in the culture&#x2014;from the R&amp;D lab to the microbrewery, to the farmers market, to the community cooking classes, to the web, packaging, book design and TV studio, to their packaging facility.<br><br>The management team commented on how the principles of Profitivity drive every decision, &#x201C;Aarstiderne owes our success to our creative bof&#xE6;llesskab [literally, &#x201C;cohabitation&#x201D;] with our customers. We keep raising the bar on surprise, and the profits follow.&#x201D;<br><br><strong>If Fast Company Had A Campus In Scandinavia, This Would Be It</strong><br><br>Henrik is convinced that every business today needs to replace their current thinking with the Profitivity insights. He&#x2019;s devised the world&#x2019;s first MBA in Business Creativity with a curriculum that is part Stanford D-School, part Design for America, focused on the process of instilling creativity into the business decisions that are made in every industry, every day. The Masters of Business Creativity&#x2014;set to enroll their first students in the Fall of 2013 at the Business Institute in Aalborg&#x2014;Denmark, will train everyone to think completely differently about business, shifting their focus from spreadsheets to imagination.<br><br>The curriculum will teach business students how to tap into their own creative aptitude, connect with a global community of experts in fields ranging from design to technology to logistics, and expose everyone to Skype sessions with experts, lab simulations, and field experiences (like the Aarstiderne farm) that demonstrate Profitivity in action.<br><br>Stay tuned and wax your board, preparing to surf the waves of change&#x2014;Henrik Hyldgaard is out to build a global network of like-minded, &#x201C;profitating&#x201D; people to get involved in his mass movement, with a bigger vision to involve a larger crowd to tackle issues of sustainability, fashion, manufacturing, financial services, and edgy product design.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Budget cuts and inefficiencies are just a few of the problems U.S. schools have faced for some time, however some educational institutions are coping with these issues by integrating technology into their learning goals, and one online educational specialist takes notice.Classrooms have greatly evolved in recent years, thanks to the rise of digital technology, increased emphasis on diversity, and widespread use of social media. While some schools have slowly adapted to these trends, others have embraced the changes and essentially redefined the educational experience&#x2014;not just in terms of learning, but also the way students interact with teachers and one another.<strong>Going Digital</strong><br> Earlier this year, Education News noted the <a href=\"http://www.educationnews.org/technology/obama-to-push-schools-on-digital-textbooks/\" target=\"_blank\">emphasis on computer science education in American schools</a>. President Obama has demanded &#x201C;greater technological literacy&#x201D; for modern students, and one way to build on this is widespread utilization of digital textbooks. According to Federal Communications Commission Chairman Julius Genochowski, textbooks cost roughly $7 billion per year to manufacture&#x2014;and despite their high cost, many are considered to be outdated and obsolete after just one or two years in the classroom. E-textbooks, most of which can be dynamically updated, do not face this problem. In most cases, they have other benefits as well. For instance, online materials allow students to learn more efficiently, which in turn enables classrooms to grow without fears that individual attention will be diminished. Another perk is a more accurate evaluation system&#x2014;using online programs, teachers can monitor and assess each student&#x2019;s progress in a real-time format.However, financial planning is a growing concern associated with the widespread implementation of online learning modules. According to Education News contributor B.A. Birch, a typical school computer lab that accommodates 20 to 40 students will <a href=\"http://www.educationnews.org/technology/california-school-adopts-ipad-program-from-kindergarten/\" target=\"_blank\">cost the district between $30,000 and $50,000</a>, and these expenses do not include software or infrastructure. For this reason, more than 1,000 American schools have adopted an innovative strategy: iPad-based education. The tablet devices afford the same educational payoff for a fraction of the cost of new desktop computers, and the mobility of these devices enables students to use them at school or at home. One school in Corpus Christi has instituted an &#x201C;iPad leasing&#x201D; program, whereby parents can rent their child an iPad for $22 per month&#x2014;a price that covers usage, insurance expenses, and e-Waste fees.This movement has been bolstered by the Apple Company, which encourages iPad users to donate their old devices when they upgrade to newer models. So far, more than 10,000 perfectly usable iPads have been collected and distributed to needy schools, where instructors sponsored by <a href=\"http://www.teachforamerica.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Teach for Americas</a> can use them in the classroom. While every TFA graduate currently uses one, the goal of Apple&#x2019;s initiative is to supply each student with his or her own iPad device.<strong>Emphasizing Understanding</strong><br> In recent years, educational experts have pointed to the need for curricula that showcases cultural diversity and demonstrates how students can foster respect toward one another, regardless of superficial differences. Assistant Professor of Education Matthew Lynch recently wrote in The Huffington Post that the ultimate goal of this approach is <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/matthew-lynch-edd/promoting-respect-for-cul_b_1187683.html\" target=\"_blank\">to prepare students for the multitude of people they will encounter in the real world once their education is finished</a>. All across the country, teachers are incorporating diversity into their lesson plans in a variety of ways.Lynch notes a number of culturally friendly activities that teachers can employ. By exposing children to photographs or videos of everyday people in foreign countries with &#x201C;exotic&#x201D; customs and &#x201C;strange&#x201D; attire, teachers can show their students that the world is populated with people who are just like them. He also recommends lesson plans that highlight positive role models from various racial and ethnic backgrounds; these figures and their contributions to a wide range of fields (such as politics, science and peace) enable students to &#x201C;value diverse cultural backgrounds as a whole.&#x201D; He notes that educators should strive to create a &#x201C;culturally responsive learning environment&#x201D; by showing equal appreciation for all backgrounds, as well as encourage students to foster an appreciation for their own culture and upbringing. These steps will effectively counteract the negative cultural stereotypes that are pervasive in movies and television to which children are generally exposed.Lynch writes that cultural diversity has applications in virtually every school subject, from math and science to writing and art. &#x201C;Providing diverse students with examples of diverse contributors to these fields and using culture-specific subject matter when teaching core topics will help them perform better in these highly scrutinized and important domains,&#x201D; he notes. &#x201C;Placing ethnically diverse students in a situation that emphasizes the strong points of their culture&#x2019;s preferred means of learning may help provide them with a greater sense of self-efficacy and achievement.&#x201D;<strong>Social Media</strong><br> According to The Lantern, <a href=\"http://www.thelantern.com/campus/some-teachers-use-social-media-in-classroom-to-connect-students-1.2885057#.UGnz3c0e0bw\" target=\"_blank\">1.43 billion people will use social media in 2012</a> and some college professors are capitalizing on the ubiquity of online technology by incorporating it into their lesson plans. Ohio State University Chemistry Professor Matthew Stoltzfus, for example, uses a &#x201C;flipped&#x201D; class model, whereby students watch lecture videos on their own time, and designated course hours are devoted to group discussions and problem solving. &#x201C;This model is a great way for any class that wants to facilitate discussion. How well they do in class helps determine their homework,&#x201D; Stoltzfus said, adding that the discussions indicate problem areas for him to address with subsequent assignments.Other instructors have created class models that directly incorporate popular social media outlets, such as Facebook and Twitter&#x2014;sites still considered by many to be strictly recreational. While many colleges and universities expressly forbid smartphones and social media activity during classroom hours, <a href=\"http://www.collegebound.net/content/article/how-twitter-and-facebook-are-fueling-classroom-learning/19549/\" target=\"_blank\">other programs have embraced this form of technology</a> as a valuable tool for connecting students. Professors that assign students to create Twitter handles and visit each other on Facebook are not only creating additional academic resources, but are also facilitating interaction that greatly adds to the higher education experience.By utilizing a technological channel that is popular with users, professors are increasing participation among students and seeing the results. Due to the real-time format of these outlets, students can contact peers, faculty and other authorities anywhere in the world, and usually elicit a prompt response. Despite its reputation, social media platforms allow professors to approach curricula in ways that are more creative and engaging to students. The College Bound Network has said of social learning, &#x201C;Despite what you may have thought, technology doesn&#x2019;t hinder learning&#x2014;it fuels it.&#x201D;<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"In the competitive space of philanthropy and philanthrocapitalism, how do you break through the clutter and get people engaged in an issue that isn&#x2019;t the tug-on-your-heart-strings norm?This week, <a href=\"http://www.theparadigmproject.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Paradigm Project</a> hopes to do just that by starting a conversation about fuel-efficient cook stoves. They hope to bring to light the issues that women in many parts of Africa face each day walking up to 15 miles to find wood to cook food, with their live <a href=\"http://www.theparadigmproject.org/woodwalk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WoodWalk campaign</a>. It&#x2019;s a 10-day walk from San Diego to Los Angeles (October 4&#x2013;13, 2011) during which a team of founders, staff, partners, and volunteers are carrying 50-pound bundles of wood on their backs replicating the trials and challenges of the women they&#x2019;re working to help. At the finish line in Los Angeles on October 13th, they will construct an &#x201C;African cooking experience&#x201D; complete with a traditional Kenyan hut that they&#x2019;ll also be cooking in along the way. Visitors will have an opportunity to step inside and experience the smoky hut, which is equal to smoking 40 cigarettes per day.The Paradigm Project is utilizing five uncommon sense principles to get in front of the people whose help they need to create permanent change:<strong>1. Seek the truth first. <br></strong>About 3 billion people around the world are subject to open-fire cooking every day, which means forests are disappearing, women and children are dying from smoke inhalation, and families are spending vast amounts of time and money just to cook. Open fire cooking causes respiratory disease, economic instability, and immeasurable destruction of natural resources.The problem is obvious, but the solution is not. It may seem easiest to start a charity and collect donations to then donate stoves to the women in need. But the founders of The Paradigm Project studied other organizations who had pursued that path and saw issues with the lack of business and infrastructure to support the continued use of these stoves, as well as the lack of commitment from owners if the product was donated, versus being purchased at a subsidized rate. Instead, they have carefully crafted a business model that sells clean-burning and efficient &#x201C;rocket stoves&#x201D; that are connected to the carbon markets. The use of efficient cook stoves reduces emissions, which in turn generates carbon credits that are sold through European and U.S.-based carbon markets. Proceeds from these sales create a self-sustaining mechanism that ultimately eliminates the need for continued outside funding. Surplus proceeds support other community projects such as clean water, health clinics, and schools at the discretion of the community.<strong>2. Operate courageously and with conviction.<br></strong>From the time the idea for The Paradigm Project originated more than five years ago to today, the founders have put their lives on the line numerous times and have literally blown their comfort zone out the window. They mapped out their goals (5 million stoves by 2020), the benchmarks they needed to reach to get there, and then they got to work. Greg Spencer Sr. and Greg Spencer Jr., two of the founders, traveled to Kenya to experience and document the daily habits of the women there and were ridiculed by men who couldn&#x2019;t fathom why these two men were doing &#x201C;women&#x2019;s work.&#x201D; Fast-forward to this week, they are risking their health, cartilage, and spines carrying 50-pound bundles of wood for 10 straight days along the Southern California coast to bring the issue to life at the doorsteps of those who can help make change. Armed with a clear vision of the change they are going to make in the world, their commitment and optimism never waver.<strong>3. Remember, people change the world.<br></strong>While our society tends to rate stoves lower on the list of issues that are important to support, smoke inhalation kills more than 1.6 million people every year, with women and children in the disproportionate majority, and is the number one killer of children under the age of five (more than AIDS, malaria, malnutrition, and water-borne disease). This is a problem that isn&#x2019;t going to solve itself, and The Paradigm Project has boldly stepped up to tackle the issue. In their first year of business, they were projected to implement 10,000 stoves by the end of the 2011, but have already more than tripled that target and are slated to reach 60,000 stoves this year.<strong>4. Bold is admirable, but humility is sexy.<br></strong>Greg Spencer Jr. had a bold vision for the WoodWalk, and attacked the problem with confidence and humility, which is exemplified in his <a href=\"http://www.theparadigmproject.org/blog/category/woodwalk-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blog post</a> from the second day of the WoodWalk,&#x201C;It&#x2019;s all about perspective. We have a choice in doing this WoodWalk, we have a choice to eat where we want to and spend time doing what we want to with the people we want to. The reality for so many people in the developing world is that they have no choice. They didn&#x2019;t choose to be born into poverty, or disease, or orphanage and many don&#x2019;t even get to choose whether or not they go to school. But this shouldn&#x2019;t cause guilt or pity for the people that don&#x2019;t have choice, it should cause compassion and empathy and respect because most of us here have no idea what it&#x2019;s like to not have choice. I&#x2019;m not here to preach, but to try and share the story of what women go through all around the world just to cook and what we at The Paradigm Project are working to do to change that.&#x201D;<strong>5. Results count. <br></strong>The Paradigm Project has made its mission to create a compelling experience with the WoodWalk, while engaging the local community to take action and assist in raising funds as the organization develops their work in East Africa. With these necessary elements, The Paradigm Project hopes to end open-fire cooking for 25 million people by implementing more than 5 million fuel-efficient rocket stoves before 2020.You can learn more about the issue and The Paradigm Project&#x2019;s proposed solution, which has been recognized twice by the Clinton Global Initiative, <a href=\"http://www.theparadigmproject.org/why-stoves\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.

It tells the biographical story of <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/news/woman-in-gold-maria-altmann-biography\" target=\"_blank\">Maria Altmann</a>, an elderly Jewish refugee. Altmann was born into a wealthy Jewish family in Austria during the World War I.The setting of the film takes place almost sixty years after World War II while in her eighties.

She is torn between obtaining freedom and showing loyalty as her parents are too ill to make the trip. To claim her freedom would be to ensure that she would never again see her parents. Her parents admonished her to see America as the homeland of her future &#x201C;&#x2026;and from now on, we speak in the language of your future.&#x201D;&#xA0; They literally changed from speaking in German to English.

Many leaders are disruptive visionaries, but only in the vacuums of their heads. They settle for familiar language and fall into a comfortable culture. Yet, powerful visions which do not adapt to changing environments and lack clarity will fall on deaf ears and dormant hearts. It is a matter of adapting or dying.Thinking different is not enough. Thinking differently should lead to speaking different which should ultimately lead to acting differently.

I wanted to take a deeper look at curation, so I spoke to one of our collaborative partners, expert curator, trend hunter and connector of information <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cultureoffuture\" target=\"_blank\">Jody Turner</a> from <a href=\"http://www.cultureoffuture.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Culture of Future</a>.Jody is highly adept when it comes to engaging with others, collecting, sharing, and igniting ideas and trends. In Jody&#x2019;s line of work, curation is the backbone of her business and vital to her success. Trend research and analysis&#xA0;require a&#xA0;continuously updated collection of curated global content within a wide range&#xA0;of categories to allow for the&#xA0;hypothesis and predictions of future trends.Everyone&#x2019;s lives, loves, interests, and behaviors are on display for the world to see through social media 24/7. People are often overwhelmed and&#xA0;stressed due to the massive amounts of information they&#x2019;re getting, and despite the many tools and techniques available, many haven&#x2019;t&#xA0;learned to edit or curate the information or the people they are engaged with.<strong>Expert Curation Is Imperative In Business</strong>Understanding what people admire, collect, share, talk about, desire, and think about has always been imperative for companies to remain relevant.&#xA0;Defining when shifts and changes occur helps us understand the rationale behind the changes, what effects they have over time, and what and where we should focus our efforts in the future. Jody defines this&#xA0;as&#xA0;&#x201C;emotional sense-mapping,&#x201D; a process of collecting and curating&#xA0;stories, experiences, and examples that lead to&#xA0;relevant connection,&#xA0;relationship building, and opportunity strategies.<strong>Where Curation Is Making A Difference In Business</strong>Curated brilliance can be found at Nike. Jody&#xA0;worked in the&#xA0;Design Library there, where she learned trend and business&#xA0;curation from a brilliant Trend Thinker and Design Librarian&#xA0;who scoured the globe for inspiration&#x2014;everything from biomimicry to robots. It was here that&#xA0;she&#xA0;quickly&#xA0;realized that inspiration is an animal that must continuously be&#xA0;fed to successfully fuel innovation.&#xA0;Nike is an educated company that knows design&#xA0;matters but also knows that connection, engagement, and storytelling is&#xA0;equally&#xA0;important for its continued success. <a href=\"http://nikeplus.nike.com/plus/products/fuelband\" target=\"_blank\">Nike+ FuelBand</a>, <a href=\"http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/?l=shop,nikeid&amp;cp=USNS_KW_0611081618\" target=\"_blank\">NikeiD</a>, and <a href=\"http://nikebetterworld.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Nike Better&#xA0;World</a> are great examples of&#xA0;meaningful design that are relevant and curated for&#xA0;personal and social effect.Another company successfully embracing curation is <a href=\"http://www.anthropologie.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Anthropologie</a> which has brilliantly currated a mix of flea market wander-and-find&#xA0;methodology with&#xA0;modern design sensibilities. The pay off has been huge with a revenue stream of $244 million in 2011.<a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Kickstarter</a> is a successful and unique&#xA0;curation engine, enabling submitted ideas to be funded by various&#xA0;donors all over the world. The power-of-the-people voting mechanism rewards the project with the most support&#xA0;and attention with the necessary funding. Kickstarter&#xA0;enabled Scott Wilson&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://kck.st/99Fni5\" target=\"_blank\">TikTok watch</a> to become highly successful.<a href=\"http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Whole Foods</a> lives up to its mission statement appealing to their shoppers&#x2019; emotional needs. Everything is&#xA0;highly touchable,&#xA0;comfortable, and the curation flow is imperfect and&#xA0;mismatched, democratized, and welcoming.<strong>The Social Impact Of Curated Content</strong>This year Jody was voted in to <a href=\"http://sxsw.com/interactive/\" target=\"_blank\">SXSW Interactive</a>&#xA0;where&#xA0;a carefully curated group of speakers and content was collated based&#xA0;on a combination&#xA0;of algorithmic patterning, crowd voting, and top-down influencer&#xA0;selections. The content delivered by the speakers became even more valuable as fresh input and creative points of view from the crowd were&#xA0;voted on.&#xA0;SXSW interactive shows us how a mix of curated content from different sides of the fence can drive&#xA0;powerful experiences and learning.Jody recently shared several examples of change-making&#xA0;projects. An aspiring&#xA0;trend hunter from Ghana was so inspired by Jody&#x2019;s well-curated content that he and his partners created&#xA0;the mobile app&#xA0;<a href=\"http://farmerline.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Farmerline.org</a>&#xA0;to provide agro-industry&#xA0;content to farmers, increasing&#xA0;productivity and income.&#xA0;She also heard a speaker from the Milan Poly&#xA0;Institute of Technology share a&#xA0;site which he uses daily to&#xA0;share&#xA0;changes in the social innovation space that are <a href=\"http://www.sustainable-everyday.net/SEPhome/home.html\" target=\"_blank\">inspiring&#xA0;change</a> in communities across the globe. Jody is currently writing a blog on the US phenomenon <a href=\"http://ioby.org/\" target=\"_blank\">ioby.org</a>&#xA0;for <a href=\"http://www.ssireview.org/blog/entry/evolving_social_innovation_branding_in_brazil\" target=\"_blank\">Stanford Social Innovation Review</a>.<strong>Some Uncommon Sense Advice On Curation</strong>It is important for people to know what matters&#xA0;to them, their project, and their business. Once you define your own&#xA0;mission&#xA0;or your project&#x2019;s driving mission, all of the information that comes to you&#xA0;makes much more sense and may&#xA0;even light it up as it flows in.Jody believes it&#x2019;s&#xA0;important to know how trend hunters&#xA0;capture newly coined phrases and narratives, identifying&#xA0;macro-trends, big&#xA0;picture business initiatives, and emotional landscapes that are then shared&#xA0;globally. Her favorites for trend hunting are&#xA0;<a href=\"http://psfk.com/\" target=\"_blank\">PSFK.com</a>&#xA0;out&#xA0;of NYC and <a href=\"http://trendwatching.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Trendwatching.com</a>&#xA0;out of London.Jody lives lightly and mobile, curating ideas of desire versus objects of desire. When she indulges she loves to collect simple, humble objects both modern and historic. These items could be from her <a href=\"http://trendwatching.com/seminars/\" target=\"_blank\">speaking travels</a>, <a href=\"http://aplusd.org/\" target=\"_blank\">museums</a> she&#x2019;s associated with, designers she&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.marcelwanders.com/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">associated with</a> or her parents&#x2019; life (late &#x2018;40s Kyoto). How it all works together is important to her and that resolve keeps her curation mindset satisfied.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span><em>Photo: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/ncindc/6906769494/sizes/o/in/photostream/\" target=\"_blank\">NCinDC</a></em>"

       "content_body":"It&#x2019;s rare to meet a leader of an organization who has lived the life of those they help. Chuck Samuelson is one of those people. Founder of <a href=\"http://kitchensforgood.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Kitchens for Good</a>, food provocateur, and exceptional company leader, Chuck is kind, caring and humble.Chuck is chock-full of inspiration (and recipes). We sat with him over a magnificent supper to dive deeper into the Kitchens for Good story, his personal passions and his uncommon lens on the world.<strong>Chuck&#x2019;s passion and values are embedded throughout his organization. </strong><em>&#x201C;I understand that often people fail to succeed not by any defect in themselves, but because of the circumstances of their birth or events in their lives. I come from a broken home. I am a recovering addict. I have been homeless. I know what it is like to have to start over. I believe that everyone deserves a second chance.&#x201D;</em>Chuck built his business model with a second chance in mind. Kitchens for Good is a social enterprise that creates jobs, supports local farmers and local communities. Through innovative programs in workforce training, healthy food production, and social enterprise the brand is breaking the cycles of food waste, poverty and hunger. Kitchens for Good works directly with farmers and wholesale companies to purchase and rescue unwanted fruits and vegetables with cosmetic imperfections or that lack commercial demand. All donations and purchases are gathered at a food processing hub where staff, students and volunteers use it to make healthy meals, snacks, and food products for social services agencies across San Diego.Chuck spends most of his time at work heading the social enterprise side of the business. Always looking towards the future and ensuring that the brand stays focused, he often asks himself, <em>&#x201C;Given what we know now, how do we get to where we want to be in 3, 5, 10 years?&#x201D;</em><strong>A humble leader.<br></strong>Chuck is exceptionally humble. He turns to the people he works with each day for inspiration. <em>&#x201C;The amazing team of folks I get to work with every day and our students are the true heroes of this story.&#x201D;</em>When we asked him about the most meaningful story he&#x2019;s heard in his travels, Chuck&#x2019;s response was, <em>&#x201C;Two things that were said by students who have graduated from our program. The first was &#x2018;This program is the first thing I have ever completed other than a prison sentence.&#x2019; The second was &#x2018;I&#x2019;m living Chuck&#x2019;s dream.&#x2019; The reality is just the opposite. I&#x2019;m living the dream that these students make happen every day.&#x201D;</em>&#xA0;<strong>A love of good food.<br></strong>Chuck is a true foodie. And although he couldn&#x2019;t tell us what his favorite food is&#x2014;because he loves them all&#x2014;he does have a particular fondness for cheeseburgers. But, if he had to eat only one cuisine for the rest of his life, it would be Chinese. <em>&#x201C;There is so much variety that I would never get bored.&#x201D;</em>Chuck doesn&#x2019;t have a favorite restaurant, but he did share a few he frequents in San Diego. For fish tacos his choice is Oscar&#x2019;s Mexican Seafood in Encinitas. And for breakfast he frequents Mama Kat&#x2019;s in San Marcos (he recommends the corned beef hash and eggs).<strong>A healthy dose of uncommon sense.<br></strong>Chuck defines uncommon sense as the unwillingness to let go of your dream. His dream has grown for more than two decades. <em>&#x201C;Because I was unwilling to let go of this dream, I was able to find the supporters who would help make it happen. Sometimes all you can do is tell your story. Eventually, if your story resonates with enough people, you can make your dream into a reality. Uncommon sense let me know in my heart when it was time to leave the comfort of a well paying job to start Kitchens For Good.&#x201D;</em><strong>Uncommon Sense principles Chuck lives by.</strong>&#xA0;If you&#x2019;re interested in becoming involved visit&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.kitchensforgood.org/\">www.kitchensforgood.org</a><span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"My wife and I recently renovated our home. And when I say we renovated it, I mean we actually renovated it. No contractors, no skilled labor, no guys in overalls. Do-it-yourself home renovation is akin to allowing your niece to perform a root canal because she someday hopes to become a dentist. Nonetheless, we donned old jeans and t-shirts and ripped out drywall, replaced old stairwell banisters and demolished weathered basement bars hiding too many secrets to be allowed to live on any longer. Daunting is the polite word that comes to mind. There are others I can share with you over a beer, with no children present.Given the level of difficulty (for us, at least) of most of these processes&#x2014;the prospect of selecting and ordering new appliances seemed like the proverbial cakewalk of the job. And in some ways it was. But shortly after installing the new dishwasher we found that a critical venting hood had fallen off the bottom of the door and now this dual-threat appliance was bathing our newly refinished wood floor in a daily sauna treatment. And it turns out steam is a surprisingly effective topcoat remover. Having just covered the floor in five coats of stain and varnish, this was not a happy sight. Time to call the appliance people.<strong>The power of real relationships</strong>Over the years I have dealt with, and worked professionally with, many brands. The percentage of brands that truly understand who their customers are and how much those customers should mean to them is frighteningly low. There are certainly no lack of brands painting a customer service fa&#xE7;ade over the surface of their organization&#x2013;but there are very few who truly understand, and more importantly, bring to life, the power of real relationships through customer care. And so I did not bring high expectations into the call with &#x201C;Appliance <u>Insert Your Favorite Realm Description Here</u>&#x201D;. They did not disappoint. The following is recreation of the facts and may be slightly embellished for dramatic purposes:Appliance Land: &#x201C;Hello. How may I help you?&#x201D;Handsome Homeowner: &#x201C;I have a warranty claim on a dishwasher I just purchased from you about 60 days ago.&#x201D;Appliance World: &#x201C;Oh. Ok. What brand is it?&#x201D;Handsome Homeowner: &#x201C;Brand X.&#x201D;Appliance Universe: &#x201C;I see. Well, you will need to contact the manufacturer for that. They like to handle warranty claims themselves in the first year of service.&#x201D;Handsome Homeowner: &#x201C;But I don&#x2019;t want to call the manufacturer. I bought this from you.&#x201D;Appliance Village: &#x201C;I&#x2019;m, sorry. I can&#x2019;t help you. You have to call the manufacturer.&#x201D;Handsome Homeowner: &#x201C;Yes, but I didn&#x2019;t buy this from the manufacturer. I am YOUR customer, not theirs. Why can&#x2019;t YOU help me?&#x201D;Appliance Hamlet: &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry, sir. It&#x2019;s just our policy.&#x201D;And thus ended the call.Insider tip: When you hear the words &#x201C;our policy&#x201D; in any customer service call, that is essentially code for &#x201C;I have no idea what the hell customer service really is, I&#x2019;m just here to answer the phone&#x201D;. You should immediately hang up, seek counseling and start to brainstorm creative ways to deploy duct tape in solving your problem. Brands like this are not going anywhere because they simply do not understand what it takes to thrive in a world where relationships define the marketplace.&#xA0;<strong>Going the extra mile is no longer optional, it&#x2019;s essential</strong>Contrast the experience above with a story I heard from a friend this week. He&#x2019;d recently had his driveway repaved and sealed in anticipation of winter. Within a week of completing it, his college-aged son parked a car with a badly leaking engine on the driveway staining the new surface. In an effort to restore it, he applied an asphalt-specific cleaning solution, which promptly proceeded to burn the sealant away. In desperation, he called the company that had done the paving for him to ask their advice on where he could get matching sealant to patch the surface. Rather than offer him a brand name (which would have been perfectly acceptable) they instead offered to come back out and fix the problem for him free of charge. Feeling a bit dumbfounded about the offer and slightly guilty at the prospect of bringing them out to fix a problem that was not of their making, he initially declined. They politely persisted. The result? A fixed driveway and a new brand loyalist singing their praises to anyone and everyone who will listen. A great example of a small, but incredibly meaningful action that not only backed this company&#x2019;s words, but multiplied their value and veracity immeasurably.The point of all of this is simple: customer service is not a set of policies or a marketing scheme. It is a culture of deep appreciation and respect for the customer that supersedes the value of the order. What was the cost for the driveway company to come out and fix those problems for my friend? Relatively high, I&#x2019;m sure, given that they were doing it on their own dime and that it was not part of the original contract budget. The better question is, though, &#x201C;What was the value of that decision that accrued to the brand?&#x201D; Not everyone is going to shout about such incredible service publically. Even if they do, quantifying the value of customer appreciation is difficult at best. And therein lies the rub. The cost of customer service is tangible and directly impacts the bottom line. The value of great customer service is difficult to quantify and often feels more like a warm belly rub than a measurable outcome. But it is also the stuff that great brands are made of.<strong>Just like love, the unquantifiable stuff is often the most powerful </strong>Great brands understand that customer service is the ultimate competitive differentiator because it is truly transformational. The value of exceptional customer service, although largely unquantifiable, is that it creates relationship where there was once only a transaction. When brands demonstrate real commitment to a customer in the form of a relationship that extends beyond the money already nestling comfortably in their pocket, the game changes. Much like the process of going from acquaintance to friend happens through time, effort and commitment, so does the process of taking someone from transactional customer to brand loyalist. It must be intentional, authentic and consistent. And this takes tremendous effort, time and expense. But when a real relationship is achieved, brands become more than the sum of their parts by eliciting a form of reciprocal commitment that exponentially increases the lifetime value of each customer.How is your brand building real relationships with your customers? A great product is a good starting point, but it&#x2019;s not enough. How are you showing your customers appreciation for the commercial relationship they are pursuing with you? You don&#x2019;t need to go overboard to achieve this. You simply need to stand apart from the majority of brands who are numbingly walking through the motions.And, when you empower your employees to provide just that little extra bit of attention or service&#x2014;to solve problems and leverage opportunities on the fly&#x2014;you move customers from transaction to relationship and from mere purchaser to a fan. And that&#x2019;s a policy worth pursuing.&#xA0;<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"By Mark Di SommaRecently, Dunkin&#x2019; Donuts announced that it was looking at <a href=\"http://time.com/money/4887441/dunkin-donuts-new-name-rebranding/\" target=\"_blank\">dropping the &#x2018;Donuts&#x2019; part of its name</a> in selected stores in order to highlight there&#x2019;s more to the brand than the products it&#x2019;s synonymous with. But when you&#x2019;re this well known, is changing your brand name a smart move?The three most powerful elements of any brand name are identity, meaning and recognition. A great name tags a brand&#x2019;s character. You know what to expect from the way the brand identifies itself. Casual, credible, functional &#x2026; great names capture the nature of what they describe. Powerful brand names also hint at hidden meaning. Sometimes, they carry within them the synopsis of a story. (<a href=\"https://digitalsynopsis.com/advertising/meaning-of-35-famous-brand-names/\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung for example means three stars in Korean</a>, but the number 3 itself implies big, numerous and powerful.) And of course brand names provide us with cues as consumers. We recognise them. They give us something to ask for, and something to look for.<strong>THE PROS AND CONS OF A BRAND NAME CHANGE</strong><br>So given that the Dunkin Donuts name already has a clear personality, it means plenty to plenty of people and it&#x2019;s widely recognised, why would the company look at changing it? There are arguments for and against such a move. Some of the biggest brands in the world have successfully abbreviated their brand names &#x2013; Coca Cola to Coke being the most obvious and of course Starbucks famously dropped the Coffee from its own name &#x2013; but others have struggled. Pizza Hut tried to become The Hut and reverted under public pressure as consumers dismissed the initiative as an unfashionable attempt to be fashionable.So when should a brand look at changing its name? Thomson Dawson tackled this some time back when he looked at the change in <a href=\"https://digitalsynopsis.com/advertising/meaning-of-35-famous-brand-names/\" target=\"_blank\">brand name from Yousendit to &#x201C;Hightail&#x201D;</a>. Do it, he suggested, if you wish to signal a change in strategic focus and if &#x201C;the naming change will serve greater meaning, resonance and value for consumers and customers&#x201D;.Dunkin&#x2019; Donuts has a greater than 60% market share of the donut market, and a presence that runs to 11,300 restaurants globallyIn that case of course the brand was changing its name completely. Nevertheless, it&#x2019;s interesting to apply those three criteria to Dunkin&#x2019; Donuts proposed change. Does Dunkin&#x2019; as a name carry greater value than the original? Sure, it gets round the recognition issue, in that half the original name is there. And yes, in a world where people are interested in greater brand minimalism and simplicity, it could be seen to bring greater resonance to a market where it&#x2019;s harder and harder to stand out. But, as to the third criteria, only time will tell whether consumers see enhanced value in the abbreviated version. After all, the company is currently the undisputed leader of the donut industry with a greater than 60% market share, and a presence that runs to 11,300 restaurants globally.What&#x2019;s the biggest risk here? <a href=\"http://www.thedieline.com/blog/2017/8/1/mismanaging-a-brands-visual-assets-why-danones-dumex-brand-failed-in-vietnam\" target=\"_blank\">Danone&#x2019;s Dumex brand failed in Vietnam</a>, Mathijs Allet says, because messing with the brand codes too heavily confuses customers, and makes the brand less attractive. &#x201C;You put doubt in the consumer&#x2019;s mind as you force them to ask themselves the question if that new looking brand is still the same product they used to buy, or a completely new product &#x2026; A relaunch where you change too many key elements too drastically makes the shopping process significantly harder and can result in a massive drop in sales due to the confusion you as a brand owner create.&#x201D;One of the other problems with changing your brand name is that in simplifying your look, you can make your brand too simple &#x2013; to the point where it looks like a house brand rather than the powerhouse consumer brand you want it to be. Removing key elements can strip a brand of much needed personality in an age where consumers are heavily dependent on visual and verbal cues to ascertain whether a brand is for them.No-one&#x2019;s suggesting that Dunkin Donuts faces either of those particular risks with its proposed change, but Allet&#x2019;s point about making change that is meaningful and that retains what matters to consumers is absolutely spot-on.<strong>THE CRITICAL CONSIDERATION IS: WHAT DOES THIS BRAND NAME CHANGE SIGNAL?</strong><br>My question is this: what will shoppers get from the Dunkin&#x2019; brand that they don&#x2019;t get from Dunkin&#x2019; Donuts? Both literally &#x2013; as in association. And experientially &#x2013; in terms of the shopping experience and the choice of products. If the answer is nothing that is dramatically different new (so far, the company has talked about potentially rolling out a new image, more emphasis on beverages and leadership in coffee), then what exactly does the change signal?The point is that every change you make to your brand is a signal to the market that things will not be as they were. What Dunkin&#x2019; Donuts seems to be signalling though is a shift that could just feel like a brand looking to keep up with the times. People may like that, and welcome it. Or they may not. Because they may see value in it happening, or they may perceive no important difference&#x2014;in which case they might prefer that things stay as they are.Original post: <a href=\"http://markdisomma.com/2017/08/20/what-can-happen-when-you-change-your-brand-name/\" target=\"_blank\">M</a><a href=\"http://markdisomma.com/2017/08/20/what-can-happen-when-you-change-your-brand-name/\" target=\"_blank\">arkdisomma.com</a>About the author: <a href=\"http://markdisomma.com/about-me/\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Di Somma</a> is&#xA0;preoccupied with what makes sectors and people tick, and by what happens when market dynamics and human reactions collide.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"I recently met with the CEO of The&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.thehonorfoundation.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Honor Foundation</a>, an executive leadership institute that serves the Special Forces community by equipping them to successfully make the transition from service into the private sector. During our first meeting Joe Musselman told me a story that highlighted the humility of a Navy Seal. The story was about a military Captain who would always wait at the back of the line when boarding civilian flights because it was a reminder to himself that he was in the business of serving others and his country. What struck me about that simple story was the complete lack of selfishness. A few days after speaking with Joe, I listened to a friend speak about the notion of small gestures of love and how they can change lives. These two events sparked my thinking about how I serve others and what we can all do to make people&#x2019;s lives better both personally and in business.<strong>Doing something for others (often) brings out the best in you</strong> <br>I&#x2019;m part of a group of guys from all walks of life who travel to Mexico three times a year to build houses in an extremely poor area outside of Tecat&#xE9;. We invite people to build with us, and to see firsthand how others live in abject poverty just 30 minutes from the United States border. At the end of a hard day&#x2019;s work, we hand over the keys to a new house to a family who&#x2019;ve been living under tarps with no roof or front door, and it never fails to bring tears to the homeowner and their family, and to everyone who built the home. The conversation that always starts on the drive home is how simple it is to make a big difference for those with so much less, and why don&#x2019;t we do it more often. The transformative impact of doing something for others brings joy, gratitude and practical perspective to everyone involved.<strong>A&#xA0;simple act of love can launch a life&#xA0;<br></strong>If building houses isn&#x2019;t your thing, your efforts can be much simpler. There are people in our lives who need to hear words of encouragement, know that they are loved, important or just doing a great job. I heard a friend who works helping ex-gang members and prison inmates, tell a story that reminded me that small gestures can be just as transformational as big ones. As a high school teenager, he was a self-described awkward, shy, geek with no confidence, and every day his father would leave a simple yellow note in his lunch box that said,&#xA0;<em>&#x201C;Dear Mike, have a great day at school. I love you. Dad</em>&#x201D;. Mike points to the confidence his dad&#x2019;s words gave him each day to face his challenges and overcome the fear of living. The power of a hand-written note should not be underestimated.<strong>Make someone in your life a VIP for a day<br></strong>It feels like I&#x2019;m in a hotel room a little too often. Last week after getting off a redeye, I arrived at the&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.kimptonhotels.com/\">Kimpton Hotel</a>&#xA0;in New York to the quiet &#xA0;and pleasant announcement that I was their VIP Guest for the day. While it felt more like a small gesture by the end of a long day, as it involved a simple note, a bottle of water and a bag of pistachios, it was the fact that they made me feel special upon arrival that made the difference. I believe there are many opportunities for Kimpton to elevate their promise, but the idea of making someone a VIP for the day is brilliantly simple.<strong>I&#x2019;d like the &#x201C;Nice to Meet You&#x201D; discount&#xA0;<br></strong>I experiment with haggling and it drives my wife crazy, but I like to see what the real price is for goods and services. Is there a hidden discount, a special price, an underground menu? As consumers, we&#x2019;ve been trained to pay the price on the label. I often ask if there is a discount available or if I can get one. I was shopping with my wife and daughter last week, and upon paying the bill I said, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s very nice to meet you, might there be a discount for a man like me?&#x201D; At first the cashier smiled and said no, then with a little teasing she said, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve just found a Nice to Meet You discount, I can give you $15 off.&#x201D; It was brilliantly simple that she had the freedom to provide a moment of value and a lasting impression with me that will bring me back to that store.<strong>Designed acts of kindness and appreciation<br></strong>American businesses have more loyalty cards and programs than the rest of humanity, and for the most part these programs are inert and meaningless. Brands spend millions of dollars every year on programs that don&#x2019;t move the needle or make a difference in their customers&#x2019; lives. Having worked for many brands where we look at loyalty and the consumer relationship as an opportunity to create value and build relationships, there is always room to shift the lens from creating customer loyalty (which seems dated) to showing appreciation for their consideration and their business. Design acts of kindness and appreciation at various and meaningful points in your relationship with your customers, your employees and your loved ones. Asking yourself,&#x201C;What have I done today to make someone feel special?<em>&#x201D;</em>&#xA0;is a great catalyst to help make the world a happier place and your business more lovable.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span><em>Photo: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/78019868@N05/7005743072/\" target=\"_blank\">David Hodgson</a></em>"

       "content_body":"To be inspired? To be challenged? To be coached?&#xA0;Or all of the above? I was having breakfast recently with the CEO of one of the world&#x2019;s&#xA0;finest retailers and we were discussing what makes a great leader. We meet regularly to talk about what&#x2019;s happening at the&#xA0;intersection of business, life and the world at large. He&#x2019;s one of the most critical thinking, effective leaders I&#x2019;ve had&#xA0;the&#xA0;pleasure of working with and learning from. Our breakfast started with an intense conversation around a range of&#xA0;subjects, but we jumped right into a spirited discussion about our options for the next leader of this great nation. We talked at length&#xA0;about the shortage&#xA0;of effective and inspiring leaders ready to step up and run our country.&#xA0;Great leaders inspire, and by their very presence create confidence and the belief that anything is possible&#x2014;no matter the prevailing&#xA0;conditions. We&#xA0;agreed that whether you lead a nation, a&#xA0;company, a sports team or any&#xA0;other group of people, the qualities, characteristics and&#xA0;skills required to lead effectively are&#xA0;very similar. As you look at where you are on the ladder of leadership&#x2014;at the top, in the middle or just putting one foot on the rungs&#x2014;here&#x2019;s a look at the basic skills required to live the definition of a leader.<strong>A leader inspires belief&#xA0;<br></strong>Great leaders cast a compelling vision for the change they expect to see in the world and for the future. They lay out a clear purpose for the organization and then set the context for the business with a clear and compelling strategy. Great leaders help to nurture the individual and institutional belief that anything is possible, and they effectively harness the collective capability and skills of the group to achieve results. Look at Tesla founder <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" target=\"_blank\">Elon Musk</a>. While he has led the impressive rise of Tesla Motors, his true focus is to reduce global warming through&#xA0;sustainable energy&#xA0;production. You only have to look at his commitment to his <a href=\"https://www.teslamotors.com/gigafactory\" target=\"_blank\">Nevada Gigafactory</a> to understand how serious he is about realizing his vision.&#xA0;<strong>A leader challenges people to think<br></strong>Leaders must be able to inspire, challenge and engage people to believe that they can achieve their potential. They are great listeners who don&#x2019;t feel like they need to have all of the answers, or have all of the plays figured out. They know how to ask the right questions and when to challenge their teams to think through solutions to the answers. Howard Schultz, the infamous founder and CEO of Starbucks, is at the helm of the now multi-billion-dollar giant, keeping it real. Celebrated and respected as a visionary, he is admired for his ability to see around corners and has a knack for asking the right questions at the right times and challenging his leadership team to do the same.&#xA0;<strong>A leader builds trust&#xA0;<br></strong>Fear, caution and self-preservation are just a few of the symptoms of organizational dysfunction that fester and slowly undermine the full potential of an organization when trust is absent. Respect, honesty and accountability are the positive ingredients for building a culture of trust. Leaders must&#xA0;operate with the highest degree of integrity, authenticity and consistency to model behaviors that inspire and guide their teams. This only happens when their actions and decisions are guided by a clear set of actionable values that the entire organization operates within. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/searsjeffery\" target=\"_blank\">Jeffery Sears</a>, co-founder and CEO of <a href=\"http://www.pirch.com/\">PIRCH</a>, is a rare and exceptional leader. Laser focused, he cares about every detail of his business. He ensures that his entire organization lives its purpose by ensuring that each team member is immersed in the company culture and its story through the company&#x2019;s University of Joy where they experience the brand&#x2019;s living values through their manifesto.<strong>A leader holds you accountable&#xA0;<br></strong>Purpose affirms trust, trust affirms purpose, and together they forge individuals into a working team, according to General Stanley McChrystal, best known for his command of&#xA0;Joint Special Operations Command&#xA0;(JSOC) in the mid-2000s. Great leaders believe in the value of every individual on the team, understanding what motivates each and guiding them to be their individual best. A leader understands the challenge of competition and knows that winning is paramount. The key to a team operating at maximum levels is accountability for the mission and collaboratively working to exceed expectations. According to McChrystal, &#x201C;The temptation to lead as a chess master, controlling each move of the&#xA0;organization must give way to an approach as a gardener, enabling rather than&#xA0;directing. A gardening approach to leadership is anything but passive. The leader&#xA0;acts as an &#x2018;Eyes-On, Hands-Off&#x2019; enabler who creates and maintains an ecosystem&#xA0;in which the organization operates.&#x201D;&#xA0;<strong>A leader is in service&#xA0;<br></strong>Great leaders are part coach, part communicator, part motivator and always in service of the team they lead. It&#x2019;s never about them, but rather about the people they serve. Great leaders are empathetic and highly in tune with the needs of their teams and the environments in which they are operating. They work in service of their team to solve problems, provide the needed resources and the environment where their people can thrive and do their best work. Great leaders demonstrate a genuine concern for the people in their care, (employees, consumers and shareholders) while instilling a sense that anything is&#xA0;possible for both the individual and the broader enterprise they lead. For <a href=\"https://twitter.com/neilgrimmerceo\" target=\"_blank\">Neil Grimmer</a>, founder and CEO of <a href=\"http://www.plumorganics.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Plum Organics</a>, business is always personal. He believes that every company is founded on principles that ladder back to a personal experience&#x2014;one that makes a connection with, and keeps, employees engaged. He stresses the importance of having a heart and that it&apos;s important to nourish relationships by encouraging and supporting employees to bring the company&#x2019;s mission to the world.&#xA0;Companies, like countries, require and should expect nothing less than exceptional from their leaders. It&#x2019;s a position of extreme responsibility where people&apos;s lives&#xA0;are at stake each and every day. To lead is both a responsibility and a privilege that must be taken seriously. If you&#x2019;re missing one of the above skills, you should be a leader in training.&#xA0;<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

It&#x2019;s imperative to get out of the corner office and mingle among the people you serve. &#x2018;Easier said than done,&#x2019; you may think, &#x2018;Who possibly has the time to get out to the stores, into the restaurants, or on a plane?&#x2019; Make the time. It&#x2019;s an investment in understanding what is really important to your consumers. Research presentations and statistics never paint the complete picture, and oftentimes not the right one.<br><br><strong>Get out of your comfort zone and onto the toilet</strong><br>At the start of a recent strategic brand refresh program with a national restaurant chain, we challenged the CEO and the entire executive team to go out into their restaurants. We told them to take a good friend, order lunch and midway through go to the bathroom with a camera, to sit on the toilet and to take photos. We told them to ask their friend to do the same thing (without the camera) and then talk about their observations over lunch. Yum. We then asked them to come to our kick-off workshop with their photos and their stories. Needless to say, the toilet-talk was revealing.<br><br><strong>Get real, and in doing so, get on the same page</strong><br>The executive team opened their eyes, dropped their pants and got real about their brand&#x2014;experiencing it the way their customers do, not just looking at it from a distance. While it was uncomfortable for them, it set the tone for our relationship where candor and brutal honesty are not only welcome, but expected. With the truth at the center of every challenge, unity and momentum can be created among a team to solve almost any challenge.<br><br><strong>Get everyone on the inside to experience your brand outside</strong><br>Since the bathroom experience, we&#x2019;ve been guiding the development and operationalization of a new brand strategy where we are engaging their entire 3,000 person organization. We&#x2019;re using the same eye-opening, pant-dropping approach so everyone experiences the brand in real time. In doing this, Bulldog has created meaningful and relevant context for bringing their mission to life. And, by helping each department understand and define their role in delivering on the brand promise, and bringing it to life throughout the entire customer experience, there is absolute focus on unified execution. The results show the company experiencing a double digit increase in all of its key business indicators since they pulled their pants down.<br><br><strong>TEN WAYS TO GET OUT THERE AND EXPERIENCE YOUR BRAND</strong><br>The following are ten ways to roll up your sleeves and act like a customer. You&#x2019;ll develop a new perspective and experience true customer empathy, no matter the business you&#x2019;re in:<br><br>1. Sit in the waiting room of the ER with your son or daughter late at night and see how it feels to wait for more than 30 minutes, filling out the same paperwork over and over again. What would you change?<br><br>2. Buy your product, then go straight to your competitor&#x2019;s and do the same thing. What does your brand do better? What do they do better? What did you learn?<br><br>3. Order your product online and have it delivered to your home. Does the condition and appearance of your product deliver on the promise? What did it communicate?<br><br>4. Dial up your own 1-800 number, listen to the hold music for two minutes and see if that doesn&#x2019;t raise your blood pressure. Get angry and see how long it takes you to rattle the customer service manager. What did you learn?<br><br>5. Would you recommend your product to your best friend? Why? Would they recommend it to their closest friends and family?<br><br>6. Offer your product to the first 10 customers you see. Ask them for their immediate feedback. Would they be willing to purchase the project?<br><br>7. Use your favorite search engine and enter the name of your company&#x2019;s flagship product. Hopefully you see your name at the top of the search. If it&#x2019;s not, why? What do the product reviews say? What else do you see? Can you even find your product? This is the information shoppers use to make their purchasing decisions.<br><br>8. After using one of your most popular products, read how your product is described online. What does it offer? What does it promise? Does the description match what the product delivers?<br><br>9. Go into your store and buy something. Was the experience memorable? Did it stand out as something special?<br><br>10. Stop someone who walked out of your store, restaurant, shop, etc. Ask them how their experience was. Would they recommend it? Will they come back?<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span><em>Photo: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/44124370018@N01/4753012363/\" target=\"_blank\">Flickr</a></em>"

       "content_body":"This year&#x2019;s World Cup was without a doubt the best tournament I can remember in years. It was full of exciting games, dramatic outcomes, standout performances and unexpected surprises. What more could futbol fans ask for? After a month of watching every match intently, listening to the incessant post-game banter, and feeling the buzz and energy that came with every game, I have to say, I was in mourning the week after the finals. As I savored the tournament and all it promised, I realized that there are many important takeaways that brands can apply to their everyday game. Your company is playing in a heated, daily competition where the whistle never blows. There is no rest between seasons and your players are on the pitch every game. Like a futbol team, you&#x2019;re playing for results, rave reviews and relevance, so how you play the game really matters.<strong>Great coaches guide teams to victory<br></strong>The German coach, Joachim Loew, meant business. From his sideline presence of strategically coiffed hair, crisp black shirt and total composure, he knew the game he wanted his team to play and was a master at putting the right players in the right formation every game. If you lead people, the first order of business is to coach them proactively. Understanding their talents and encouraging them to develop and grow their skills is a coach&#x2019;s responsibility. Great coaches lead their team from the sideline, but do the majority of their work during training, really learning about their players and understanding what each person needs to do their individual best. As a leader you have to know your players so they feel comfortable asking for help and guidance. It is also your job to put them into teams where each player feels as though their unique skills and hard work matter in winning the game.<strong>Winning teams know when to pass the ball <br></strong>Germany controlled every game because their players knew exactly when to pass the ball. They were masters of the pass. Every player on your team should understand the role they play and how to use their skills to support the other members of the team. They should know when and who to pass the ball to, setting up the next player for success. Great players have amazing awareness of who&#x2019;s around them, have perfect timing and know how to find space to pass the ball. Take a look at your executional problems, missed deadlines or relational challenges and you&#x2019;ll likely find that the players on your team are holding onto the ball for too long, fumbling the pass or not passing off to the right person at the right time. Great passing is a key skill in well-timed collaboration. If you work with your team on the importance of passing and improve the timing and accuracy of the pass, you will greatly enhance your results.<strong>Playing with the will to win, wins games and respect<br></strong>The US team went into the World Cup lacking a great deal compared to their counterparts&#x2014;a coach who told them they weren&#x2019;t going to win, an average lineup of players (compared to the teams in their group) and their the loss of their best player was left in the locker room because of his own arrogance. The only true world-class player on the team was the goalkeeper, Tim Howard. So what did they do better than almost every other team? And why on earth did they kick England&#x2019;s backside? They showed up with the will to win and the heart of a team who believed they could go all the way. It wasn&#x2019;t always pretty, but they played their hearts out and played to win. As a leader, it&#x2019;s important to instill the belief in your team that they can go all the way. Talent and training gets you two thirds of the way, but the heart and the will to win define how your team plays together and what they think they can accomplish. How you play the game as a company is as important as what game you are playing and gives you a distinct competitive advantage in driving culture, team retention and overall satisfaction.<strong>Defense matters every day and superstars don&#x2019;t make a team <br></strong>The Brazilian team used to conjure up expectations of poetic genius and acts of sheer futbol perfection. Every Brazilian team that preceded this one built the reputation and depth of their brand, adding to the legendary status of their golden shirts. Their most admired and feared teams had showmen, tricksters and ball masters who all worked in magical harmony, sweeping up hearts and games as they went.&#xA0;Looking back at Pele, Ronaldo, Ronaldinho to name a few, these supernovas played on Brazilian teams who had a well-rounded lineup of players in offense and defense. This tournament&#x2019;s Brazilian team was completely reliant on their one superstar, Neymar, and they muddled&#xA0;through the tournament with a totally ineffective defense. In business, relying on a single function like sales or marketing to win the game is a road to unsustainable success. As a leader you must ensure that you build a fully-rounded team if you want to win the championship. No doubt you need to have an amazing sales and marketing front line, but you must have an equally world-class customer care team and a masterful operations team to win the long-term game. Always focus on both your offense and defense.<strong>Play for the fans, not for yourself<br></strong>The goalkeepers were among the stars of the tournament. Whether it was Tim Howard or the German keeper Manuel Neuer, they did their jobs masterfully. Rodriguez of Colombia was a wonderful surprise, and despite their theatrics, players Muller, Neymar and Robben were a joy to watch. The rise of the little guys like Ghana and Costa Rica had me on the edge of my seat. The heart and tenacity of the US, the dominant precision of Germany, the drive of the Netherlands, the spirit of Argentina honored futbol fans all over the world with incredible displays of talent, tenacity and unbelievable skills. But when all is said and done, there is no World Cup without the fans. A football team, like a brand, has no relevance if it doesn&#x2019;t engage, entertain and deliver results for the fans. As a leader, ensure that your brand is fan-centric, that your team plays for, and attracts, new fans, that your brand is exciting and interesting to follow, that you play the game with spirit and that you win with style and good sportsmanship. And don&#x2019;t forget, the best uniforms in the tournament get noticed too.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span><em>Photo: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/120663298@N03/14397662776/\" target=\"_blank\">Gabriel Cabral</a></em>"

Do you speak the complicated language? Do you think there&#x2019;s a problem to solve, a need to fill or benefits to be had? Why has such&#xA0;an important&#xA0;subject been made so very complicated? That is the problem with sustainability, like most legacy-based systemic issues we&#x2019;re facing today, there are more questions raised by the subject than&#xA0;answered. The subject of sustainability is so nebulous that people&#x2019;s eyes glaze over when you bring it up, because they&#x2019;re intimated to even talk about it.I have been involved in a number of sustainability projects with major corporations and one of the biggest observations I have is that until sustainability gets framed correctly and is directly&#xA0;connected to financial performance, it will continue to be a misunderstood annoyance rather than a strategic imperative for corporations and their C-suites. It&#x2019;s sad to say, but we need to position sustainability more in terms of money and efficiency rather than about saving the planet.One may ask, &#x201C;Who should be operating with a sustainability model?&#x201D;&#xA0;This is like asking the question, &#x201C;Which company should produce a quality product and which should not?&#x201D;&#xA0; Who doesn&#x2019;t want a quality product?&#xA0;What company is going to be in&#xA0;business long term if it creates low quality products?&#xA0;I think there are new business rules that&#xA0;are being&#xA0;verified. I don&#x2019;t think sustainability is a choice anymore. What company would not&#xA0;want to reduce operating costs, and variation in their processes, lower overall company risk, provide innovation into their product line, and engage and retain loyal customers?I thought I&#x2019;d talk to my friend Catherine Greener, the CEO of Cleargreen Advisors to get an expert&#xA0;perspective on how to turn the conversation about sustainability from eco-efficient to re-inventive.<strong>What does Sustainability mean?<br></strong>Catherine: It will be 10 years next week that I left my very comfortable life in Detroit and the automotive industry and began my career in this field that folks call <em>sustainability</em>. The more I work in this field, the&#xA0;more I question whether there is&#xA0;even&#xA0;such a thing as sustainability or a Sustainable Business. Perhaps it is an illusion. What I do know, and know with certainty, is there is absolutely something&#xA0;that we can call &#x201C;Un-Sustainaiblity&#x201D;. We can call it externalities, or unintended consequences, or toxicity, or pollution or simply waste. It is the result of a take-make-use-waste model&#xA0;and a lack of owning the consequences of our impacts.What we call sustainability is the beginning of the understanding of the unsustainable predicament we are in and how we are starting to correct it. We think about how to reduce our dependence&#xA0;on linear extractive models, how to use less natural resources, become innovative in our product designs and understand what happens when we throw &#x201C;it&#x201D; away.&#xA0;We learned from the Total Quality&#xA0;Movement that variation and waste are expensive. Planet Earth is a closed system where waste in any form is just that&#x2026;waste. By focusing on eliminating waste, a company can become&#xA0;more sustainable, save money, increase profitability and thus performance.Paul Hawken, among others, envisions a future in which companies &#x201C;sidestep the commercial Tower of Babel that spills forth such irrelevant abundance, wastes so much and does so little&#x201D; in&#xA0;favor of &#x201C;products that cut through the clutter of our lives and allow us to perform the daily acts of living in a more satisfying way.&#x201D;&#xA0;&#xA0;(The Ecology of Commerce, p. 154)We cannot and will not find a sustainable path if we continue to bind&#xA0;ourselves to the same financial rules. This is why we have compiled nine Uncommon Sense steps every company should have taken by now:<strong>1. Understand where the largest environmental and social risks are. Know what you need to know.<br></strong>Today we have 7 billion people on the planet, and it&#x2019;s said it can sustain 15 billion people if we consume food and resources like the people of Rwanda. In contrast, the planet can sustain only 1.2 billion people if we consume food and resources like the people of the US. Almost every natural system that supports life is in&#xA0;decline or fighting for survival.&#xA0;In this country, we consume only 50% of our food and the other 50% goes to&#xA0;waste. We are an overweight, bloated nation&#xA0;with a broken economic system. Our healthcare, financial infrastructure, education and food systems are broken due to&#xA0;waste and inefficiency. It&#x2019;s obviously time to rethink&#xA0;and&#xA0;reinvent&#xA0;these vital backbone systems, and corporations should take careful notice of what is happening here. We all exist and depend on&#xA0;these systems, and to avoid the creation of &#x201C;re-designed sustainable systems&#x201D; and the consequence of our actions is to put our immediate future in jeopardy.<strong>2. Conduct a baseline of your company&#x2019;s water, solid waste, energy and carbon emission usage by unit (if possible). Set a reduction target. Go big.<br></strong>In 2005, Walmart surprised the world by announcing three <a href=\"http://walmartstores.com/sustainability/\">sustainability goals</a>:&#xA0;to be supplied 100% by renewable energy, to create zero waste, and to sell products that sustain people and the environment.&#xA0;Over the last five years they have repeatedly demonstrated that being green does not mean spending green. In fact, Walmart has identified millions of dollars of savings, through their own operations and their supply chain. They are a big company with a big footprint.&#xA0;They have demonstrated to thousands of companies, retail and manufacturing, that waste is expensive and uncompetitive. Get rid of waste, improve your environmental performance, decrease risk and improve your bottom line.<strong>3. Eliminate the use of bottled water and styrofoam in offices. Walk the talk.<br></strong>Over 20 billion water bottles are thrown away every year along with over 20 billion Styrofoam cups a year. Have you ever had a REALLY good cup of coffee, tea or water from a Styrofoam cup? Get rid of them and remember you can put your logo on a mug and give it to a customer.<strong>4. Eliminate unnecessary use of paper. Companies find that the real non-value added happens on what is printed on the reports that no one reads<br></strong>Recycling 1 ton of paper is like saving 17 trees and keeping 3 cubic yards of paper out of a landfill. That&#x2019;s about the size of a Volkswagen Bug. During Catherine&#x2019;s work with Lean manufacturing companies, she considered the obvious, and often looked at all the paper reports still being generated that people didn&#x2019;t really look at anymore. We have so much information at our fingertips, especially in the virtual realm. It&#x2019;s important for a company to see what people are really reading on paper, and how often.<strong>5. Engage and activate employees around sustainability and how small choices can have an impact. Empower and challenge the workforce around how your company can lead.<br></strong><a href=\"http://www.stonyfield.com/\">Stonyfield Farms</a> is one of my favorite examples of a company that is doing well by doing good. They started out decades ago as a mission-focused for-profit company, and have not wavered from&#xA0;their values and their commitment to creating a new and sustainable business model. They have a delicious product that people love and they have wrapped&#xA0;&#x201D;joy&#x201D;&#xA0;into every aspect of their brand.&#xA0;They have grown significantly, reshaped a category, have maintained their integrity through an acquisition and continue to be committed to a sustainable future. Check out <a href=\"http://www.stonyfield.com/about-us/our-story-nutshell/meet-our-ce-yo\">Gary Hirschberg</a>, CEO of Stonyfield Farms, on TedX for a full perspective.<strong>6. Understand the sustainability risks and impacts of your company&#x2019;s supply chains. For many companies this is the heavy lifting.<br></strong>Our Industrial and consumer systems are fraught with waste. We take it for granted. The average American throws away almost 5 pounds of garbage every day. Those are some really good BTU&#x2019;s (British Thermal Units) that&#xA0;we are entombing in landfills. Almost everything that we buy in a year ends up in a landfill within one year. We throw away enough aluminum to make almost 3 million aluminum four cylinder engines, picture dragging those out to the curb on garbage day.Think about all the raw materials that we toss out. What could happen if we reclaimed all those great BTU&#x2019;s? &#xA0;Will our grandchildren or our great grandchildren mine our landfills to recover all&#xA0;the good stuff we&#x2019;re losing by putting them in this nonexistent place called &#x201C;away&#x201D;?&#xA0;Right now&#xA0;we&#x2019;re in an endless loop whereby we pull materials from the earth, process them, use them for the blink of an eye, and then retire them to a dump. &#xA0;These materials still have utility, but we replace&#xA0;them with new materials, which often cost more because of their ever-increasing scarcity. Or can we save our grandchildren the trouble by imagining a new reality in which we close the loop?Why can&#x2019;t we recover these materials and start an endless virtuous cycle? &#xA0;This would keep prices constant or drive them even lower, reduce risk, increase competitiveness, and create jobs in the&#xA0;process. One of the untold stories about the electric car, Nissan Leaf, is how committed that company is to reducing waste around that product. There are numerous examples of&#xA0;recycled and reclaimed materials that are being used in that vehicle. And, the US plant, in Smyrna, TN has a small army of employees engaged and committed to driving out all kinds of wastes&#xA0;throughout the supply and manufacturing chains. Even better, they find that they save money along the way.<strong>7. Support the health and wellness of employees.<br></strong>When we think about sustainability, we often think of the big issues like climate change, deforestation, ocean acidification, etc. But, sustainability begins with you&#x2014;your values and the consequences of your actions. We call this Behavior Based Sustainability. How can you save the world if your own home is not in order? Small actions can lead to big changes and ideas. Some of our clients have helped employees by supporting smoking cessation, healthy eating, exercise, gardening, and recycling programs.<strong>8. Find uncommon partnerships to help solve problems that are bigger than you are. Innovate, Innovate then Innovate some more.</strong>Eco-efficiency is such a great place to start. It is easy to demonstrate operational expenditure reductions before moving to innovation &#x2013; which can take additional investment and which sometimes doesn&#x2019;t&#xA0;produce quick wins. Innovation is critical but you have to plan it. Cleargreen Advisors helps clients plan and sequence these things &#x2013; efficiency first, innovation next &#x2013; so they make business sense and yield financial&#xA0;returns.&#xA0;One of our favorite win-win examples is the Pepsi-Waste Management Dream Machine Kiosks that are being installed at retailers around the country. People recycle and redeem points and&#xA0;PepsiCo donates funds to the Entrepreneurship Bootcamp for Veterans with Disabilities, a national program that offers free training in entrepreneurship and small business management for veterans with disabilities. There is an increased recycling rate as people recognize recycling as a routine behavior. It&#x2019;s a win for people, planet and profits when a non-profit gets funding while more recycled content is used as a raw material rather than sitting in landfills.<strong>9. Tell stories. Your stories. You will be surprised who is listening and whom you are inspiring.</strong> <br>You have an authentic and transparent story to tell, the keyword being <em>authentic</em>. These stories are really just great marketing. GE&#x2019;s Ecomagination is a business initiative to help meet customers&#x2019; demands for more energy-efficient products that in turn help to drive reliable growth for GE in this growing category. It&#x2019;s a great story that is dynamic, engaging and effective.<strong>So what&#x2019;s next for sustainability?<br></strong>We are at an inflection point, but we have not yet &#x201C;tipped&#x201D; when it comes to sustainability. Companies have made amazing strides around packaging, transportation, energy use reduction and other&#xA0;things, but the message is being diluted at the shelf. Consumers are not fully engaged around sustainable consumption yet. If you wanted to bet that shoppers are going to be more or less interested&#xA0;in this issue in the future, where would you place your bet? Companies who have figured out how to delight the shopper with their products and sustainable innovations are demonstrating terrific&#xA0;market growth. We still have a land of confusion around messaging and certifications that shoppers have not figured out. We don&#x2019;t really have a strong&#xA0;mandate to make the change&#x2013;from shoppers, the government or even most retailers.We believe there is a significant opportunity for every organization to develop an Eco-Efficiency plan, to explore increasing financial performance, developing innovation and building&#xA0;deeper relationships with employees and customers by putting&#xA0;Eco-Efficiency in the middle of the plan.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

       "content_body":"Although it was eleven years ago, I can still close my eyes and hear the silence on the other end of the phone as though it was yesterday. The silence came from my mom right after I finished telling her that instead of accepting a job offer from one of the most well respected public accounting firms in the world, I was going to pursue a job working for a faith-based non-profit. The silence became louder when I mentioned that I&#x2019;d be responsible to fundraise from my friends and family to pay for my micro-salary.<br><br>She finally broke the silence to say that although she considered my plans noble and worthwhile, I must have forgotten that I&#x2019;ve been wired to enjoy the &#x201C;finer things in life&#x201D; like playing golf at country clubs, driving nice cars, and enjoying expensive meals. The example she and my dad had set for me was to work hard to provide a great lifestyle, then volunteer for a cause. I was bucking the trend, changing the traditional game and deciding to make my cause my work. It was disruptive for them, and certainly risky for me because she was right&#x2014;and I knew I&#x2019;d be closing the door to the Member-Guest tournaments, driving the latest BMW, and attending the awards dinners in my honor. But I intuitively knew that if I chose that path then I&#x2019;d be making the decision to pursue the things that would leave me empty, lonely, and confused. I had to work for a cause, I had to know that my work made a difference and I had to make a mark.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve grown up a lot since then, and continued to ponder the difference between working for applause or working for a cause. Really, I am still constantly struggling with the temptation to chase the old version of applause: money, kitchen remodels, new cars, promotions, and memberships. I know to the depths of my core that those things aren&#x2019;t important&#x2014;they&#x2019;re temporal and fleeting, and I&#x2019;ll always need more. Truth be told though, I do feel inferior when my friends talk about their applause, and I frequently compare myself to where my parents were at financially when they were my age. Applause can be so deceptive.<br><br>Now, society has changed and I&#x2019;m growing up on the front end of a generation that&#x2019;s been working hard to redefine everything&#x2014;choosing to write a different story where success is measured by things like social impact, lives changed, babies saved, and water sources cleaned. It&#x2019;s become cool to work for a cause.<br><br>Before we celebrate the shifts and declare a cause-driven world to be better, we need to examine how the same temptation to work for applause has crept into our causes.

It&#x2019;s still important for us to know if we&#x2019;re on the right track, even if we&#x2019;re largely unnoticed and unrecognized by social media or blogs. So, what does applause in a cause-world look like?<br><br>&#x2022; Impact: The most important applause for a job well done is the actual impact to your stakeholders, the stories of lives inspired, saved or changed.<br>&#x2022; Fulfillment: Your work matters, and it feels good and satisfying.

No matter what happens, no one can take away the stories from you.<br>&#x2022; Drive: People who work for a cause find that they&#x2019;re tireless when compared to others. They find unexpected energy being caught up in something that&#x2019;s bigger than them, and it&#x2019;s worth getting out of bed in the morning.<br>&#x2022; Profit: Ken Blanchard has said, &#x201C;Profit is the applause for taking care of your customers and your people.&#x201D; People who work for a cause find that money is attracted to passion, impact, focus, and efficiency.<br><br><span><strong>Three uncommon sense tips to start working for a cause</strong></span><br>I have many friends who work in traditional corporate settings who see their lives very differently than they see mine. It&#x2019;s easy to tell that I work for a cause, and not so easy to figure out how working at a large communications company, mid-sized accounting firm, or at a heating and air conditioning service company could be cause-driven. If you find yourself there, here are three uncommon sense tips to start working for a cause, right where you are:<br><br><strong>1. Find new friends</strong><br>If you notice that the normal conversation between you and your close friends revolves only around the best new restaurant, the next vacation, or whom you&#x2019;ve met lately, find new friends. Start spending time with people who are leaning forward, have their palms up, and are constantly wondering what it looks like to make a splash.<br><br><strong>2. Change your job</strong><br>As you search deep within yourself, if you can&#x2019;t find one ounce of passion or pride in what you do, what your company does, or the industry you&#x2019;re in&#x2014;quit. Change your job. Start over. Seriously. I have a friend who works as an internal auditor in a large, multi-national company. When I challenged him about whether or not he works for a cause, he quickly snapped back that his company makes the medical devices that save lives all across the planet and he&#x2019;s proud to be a part of that. If you don&#x2019;t have that same spark, find it now.<br><br><strong>3. Pick a fight</strong><br>I remember watching a guy sucker punch another dude in the cheap seats at a professional football game. They got into a brawl that disrupted an entire section of fans. If you don&#x2019;t have a cause, pick one. Spend some time in self-reflection figuring out what fires you up or pisses you off. If you can&#x2019;t think of anything, then just sucker punch yourself and sign up for something&#x2014;anything&#x2014;to get your hands dirty and your nose bloody.<br><br>For the next stage of my life, I&#x2019;m looking to be the one who gives applause. With Shawn Parr, Gregg Imamoto and Megan Grable at Bulldog, we&#x2019;ve spent a year building the YouSchool&#x2014;a company whose entire purpose is to unlock the potential in others. We offer a program to help high school and college students get clear on who they are and what they&#x2019;re wired to do, then unleash them with the tools they&#x2019;ll need to plan a life built for them. The applause we&#x2019;re hoping for is impacting at least one life and cheering them on as they make a splash in the world. Stay tuned as we spend this year cracking the code in San Diego, and onward in 2014.<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span>"

It is an interdisciplinary process in which&#xA0;biological principles and elements are&#xA0;studied in order to draw analogies to be&#xA0;applied to human innovation.&#xA0;??Is it the latest new fad in design??Looking to nature for innovation is not a new&#xA0;concept, consider&#xA0;Leonardo da Vinci studying birds and bats&#xA0;to design his flying machines. However, the&#xA0;systematic&#xA0;application of adaptations to human design and engineering challenges is&#xA0;relatively new.&#xA0;With today&#x2019;s advancements in fields such as&#xA0;nanotechnology, we are now able to study nature on an incredibly small scale. As&#xA0;Paul Saffo, the noted futurist says, every 30 years or so, one science&#xA0;discipline plays a transformative role in creative technology that shapes or&#xA0;lives. We are now entering the age of biology.<strong>What can we learn from nature?</strong><br> The 30 million&#xA0;species represent a reservoir of inspiration for solving challenges while&#xA0;remaining environmentally sustainable.&#xA0;Every species have unique&#xA0;characteristics that enable their survival, and&#xA0;learning from analogous solutions in nature&#xA0;presents a tremendous opportunity to address&#xA0;diverse industry&#xA0;challenges.<strong>Why should we pay attention to nature?</strong><br> As demand for natural&#xA0;resources continues to increase, there is a growing cost to companies,&#xA0;consumers, and the environment. If we want to survive and&#xA0;thrive in the next&#xA0;century, we must learn to design new products, systems, and processes that are&#xA0;more efficient and environmentally sustainable. Nature&#xA0;offers a rich source of&#xA0;inspiration for these designs.<strong>With all our major systems broken (education, financial, food, transportation,&#xA0;health, government) how can bioinspiration help?</strong><br> Systems in nature have faced and overcome many&#xA0;of the same challenges our own systems face today. By studying the dynamics of&#xA0;a functioning&#xA0;ecosystem, we can form analogies to address problems such as:&#xA0;waste, inefficiency, and a lack of synergy between system components. In an&#xA0;ecosystem,&#xA0;waste from one species becomes the resources for another, and this&#xA0;ongoing relationship is critical for overall ecosystem function.??What companies are using/have used bioinspiration successfully to develop&#xA0;better products??There are multiple degrees of bioinspiration&#xA0;integration within companies. For example, Nike, P&amp;G, and IDEO incorporate&#xA0;bioinspiration from a design&#xA0;process and innovation perspective. There is also&#xA0;a growing amount of bioinspired products in the marketplace. To name a few,&#xA0;Qualcomm&#x2019;s mirasol&#xA0;display, Lotusan&#x2019;s paint, and Sharklet&#x2019;s antibacterial&#xA0;micro-texture technology.<strong>Where has inspiration from nature impacted major human systems successfully?</strong><br> Education:<br> &#x201C;The broad objective of the Center for&#xA0;Interdisciplinary Biological Inspiration in Education and Research&#xA0;(CiBER) [at U.C. Berkely] is to innovate methods to extract&#xA0;principles in biology that&#xA0;inspire novel design in engineering and train the next generation of scientists&#xA0;and engineers to collaborate in mutually beneficial&#xA0;relationships.??Biologists working with engineers, computer&#xA0;scientists and mathematicians are discovering general principles of nature from&#xA0;the level of molecules to&#xA0;behavior at an ever-increasing pace. Now more than&#xA0;ever before, nature can instruct us on how to best use new materials and&#xA0;manufacturing processes&#xA0;discovered by engineers, because these human&#xA0;technologies have more of the characteristics of life. This effort will require&#xA0;unprecedented integration&#xA0;among disciplines that include biology, psychology,&#xA0;engineering, physics, chemistry, computer science and mathematics. Fortunately,&#xA0;the age of integration&#xA0;is here. Nature provides useful hints of what is&#xA0;possible and design ideas that may have escaped our consideration. Given the&#xA0;unique process of biological&#xA0;evolution and its associated constraints,&#xA0;identifying, quantifying and communicating these design ideas is a challenge.&#x201D;&#xA0;SOURCE: <a href=\"http://ciber.berkeley.edu/?page_id=140%E2%80%A8%E2%80%A8\" target=\"_blank\">http://ciber.berkeley.edu/?page_id=140??</a>Financial:<br> According to a recent economic impact report Global Biomimicry&#xA0;Efforts: An Economic Game Changer, &#x201C;bioinspiration offers the means to achieve both&#xA0;environmental and economic goals. While the field today is just emerging, in 15&#xA0;years biomimicry could&#xA0;represent $300 billion annually of U.S. gross domestic&#xA0;product (GDP) in 2010 dollars.

       "content_body":"<em>If I&#x2019;ve learned anything over the past ten years, it&#x2019;s been that the old saying of &#x201C;It&#x2019;s far more rewarding to give than it is to receive&#x201D; is very powerful. I was recently invited to mentor a group of emerging social entrepreneurs, all whom are focused on business models geared towards improving the lives of others, at an intimate conference called Praxis. While I was going there to help and guide others, I left with the gift of being inspired, challenged and full of hope. While everyone I met had a compelling purpose for their business and a number of them really stood apart from the crowd, Matt Emerzian&#x2019;s brilliant story and business he&#x2019;s starting to build caught my attention. I was taken aback by his story, his openness, and vulnerability, and I&#x2019;ve shared it with anyone who will listen&#x2014;he&#x2019;s taken a day of the week and made it matter. I hope his story makes you think differently about Mondays and how you spend it as much as it has for me.</em>After graduating from grad school with his MBA from UCLA, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emerzian\" target=\"_blank\">Matt Emerzian</a> found himself in the music business. He started in artist management working with local artists, but was later hired by Robert Kardashian. While most people know Robert as an attorney in the OJ Simpson case, he was actually a music man for 35 years and owned a music marketing and promotion company. Matt was hired as his Senior Vice President.Now Matt found himself even deeper in the business. He worked with nearly every major and indie label, more specifically on projects for artists such as U2, Coldplay, Snow Patrol, Keane, Avril Lavigne, Black Eyed Peas, Tim McGraw and more. Matt worked in the office during the day and often found himself out at night living what I now call an &#x201C;Entourage&#x201D; lifestyle&#x2014;drinking, smoking weed, and objectifying women, trying to be cool in the &#x201C;City of Angels.&#x201D; It was a slow process, but a slippery slope, and soon he had created a life that was about so much that didn&#x2019;t matter. The narcissism and egos of the music industry had rubbed off on him and he thought he was the center of the universe.When he would go home to Modesto, where he grew up, everyone wanted to hear Matt&#x2019;s stories because they were always the best. Imagine being from a small town like Modesto and the next thing you know you&#x2019;re drinking champagne and smoking a joint while driving to a U2 concert in a celeb&#x2019;s limo. Then you&#x2019;re greeted at the arena by Paul McGinnis, U2&#x2019;s manager, and you watch the concert with Bono&#x2019;s wife and 3-year-old son. Or you find yourself in the middle of Time Square with Avril Lavigne and her team, and the event you are in charge of has created such a scene that it shuts down all road traffic, to the massive displeasure of the NYPD. How does that happen? How does one process that? I guess, you don&#x2019;t. You just live it up and think it&#x2019;s what life is all about.Matt thought he was doing pretty well until he went to bed on a Sunday night and woke up the next morning thinking he was having a heart attack&#x2014;his heart was racing, he was sweating like he was in a Monty Python movie, and he was freaking out. He jumped in his car and drove himself to the doctor&#x2019;s office. Not the best idea to drive a car when you think you are having a heart attack, of course, but he needed help.After examining him, the doctor concluded that he wasn&#x2019;t having a heart attack, rather he was having a severe panic attack. The doc told him to just go home and rest, and he should feel better in the morning. Well, that didn&#x2019;t work, and it didn&#x2019;t work the next day, week or month. His life began to shut down. His parents had to move in with him. He couldn&#x2019;t function, couldn&#x2019;t drive a car, couldn&#x2019;t eat, and couldn&#x2019;t sleep. At night, he couldn&#x2019;t look out the windows because he thought the sky was falling. His &#x201C;dream&#x201D; life was literally crashing down. And, he had no idea what happened or how to fix it.Fortunately, he was introduced to a therapist who changed his life. During one of his first visits she handed him Rick Warren&#x2019;s book, &#x201C;Purpose Driven Life&#x201D;, and told him to read the first sentence, which says, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not about you.&#x201D; The sentence didn&#x2019;t make any sense to Matt. Again, narcissism won the day. Then she told him that he would never feel better until he understood that concept. That got his attention because it was like a final life raft&#x2014;something to grab onto, something to help. Just four simple words were all he needed to read. They echoed in his head every minute of the day, partially from a place of gratitude and partially because he was unsure and confused. But, he was determined to put in the work and find the meaning.She then prescribed a heavy dose of volunteering&#x2014;every Saturday morning at 9am Matt would go out and pick up litter, paint over graffiti, feed the homeless, etc. At first, he didn&#x2019;t understand it, but one day it clicked when he realized that Saturday mornings were his favorite time of the week. They provided an opportunity to go out and serve others and it was &#x201C;not about him.&#x201D; It was the best he felt every week.Matt was still working in the music industry since that&#x2019;s all he knew, and he wasn&#x2019;t sure how this new concept was going to work in his life. One day he was walking back to his office with a co-worker when he bent down to pick up a piece of litter on the sidewalk and suddenly it all made sense. His co-worker asked Matt why he would pick up someone else&#x2019;s trash, only for the conversation to end in an argument.Pissed off, Matt went up to his office and called a friend, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/kelly-bozza/1/685/a34\" target=\"_blank\">Kelly Bozza</a>, and told her that he wanted to write a book. She responded, &#x201C;Matt, you don&#x2019;t even read books. How are you going to write one?&#x201D; Matt explained to her that he wanted to write a book that could explain that every single one of us matters, and together, we can change the world. They wrote the book together.His thought was if it took him one second to pick up one piece of litter, what if all 300+ million people in our country picked up just one? It would still be a collective one second, but 300+ million pieces of litter would be gone. What if we each picked up five or ten? Or, what if we got our schools, companies, churches, friends, and family involved? It is just a numbers game.What if we all smiled more, planted a tree, donated blood, wrote a note of gratitude, or took better care of our health? It just became a &#x201C;what if&#x201D; game. They picked 52 of these scenarios and wrote the book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Every-Monday-Matters-Ways-Difference/dp/1404105123\" target=\"_blank\">&#x201C;Every Monday Matters &#x2013; 52 Ways to Make a Difference.&#x201D;</a>The book came out four years ago and has sold very well; but more importantly to Matt, it started an organization and the beginning of a movement. A month after the book came out, he received an email from a woman who saved someone from committing suicide, all because of the book. He never imagined his book would literally save somebody&#x2019;s life. But, that was the sign Matt needed to walk away from the music industry and try to make &#x201C;<a href=\"https://everymondaymatters.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Every Monday Matters</a>&#x201D; a household name.From day one, thousands of people wanted to be a part of what they were doing. They started letter writing campaigns, he wrote a newspaper column every Monday that became syndicated in over 400 newspapers nationwide, and they wrote a K-12 school curriculum that teaches our youth that they matter through self and social responsibility projects. Today, they are in over 1,200 schools in 43 states, impacting the lives of hundreds of thousands of youths. They created an Employee Engagement/Corporate Social Responsibility program and are working with major corporations across the country to create a work culture where all employees feel as though they matter and have significance, within both their company and their community. They were on <a href=\"http://www.oprah.com/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Oprah.com</a> every Monday for a year and PBS just shot a documentary on EMM that will air in May 2012.They are committed to getting as many people as possible to make their Mondays matter and to understand how much they matter. &#x201C;Every Monday Matters&#x201D; is about being able to imagine a day when millions of people all over the country or world are doing the same thing on the same day to make a difference in their life and the lives of others, so that millions of people know they matter. Matt believes that together, we can officially change Mondays&#x2014;and the world.I had the opportunity to sit down with Matt to find out his thoughts behind &#x201C;Every Monday Matters&#x201D; and the true issues they are trying to solve. There are bigger issues than just making your Mondays better and Matt delves into the full details of the concept.<strong>Why does every Monday matter?<br></strong>It represents a day for all of us to do better, to be better. First, we need to stop dreading Mondays. If you really think about it, we have created a monster out of a day of the week, and the monster is so powerful that it even overpowers our Sundays. So, basically two of our seven days a week are ruined because of Mondays. Not only is that ridiculous to think about, but it&#x2019;s also pretty sad.Mondays can be a day of inspiration, a day to celebrate the start of a new week. It gives us an opportunity to make a choice. To make the simple, yet paramount choice of how we want to live our life. What if everyone started his or her week with the mindset of &#x201C;It is time to be awesome. I am going to make a difference today. I am going to be a better friend, a better husband, a better co-worker, a better citizen.&#x201D; What if every Monday was seen as a day to be better than we were the week before? That&#x2019;s powerful. That concept matters.<strong>Why does Monday matter to you?<br></strong>Monday is the day I broke down, and it is the day that changed my life forever. I certainly don&#x2019;t want to sound overdramatic, but it was, and it sucked. For the first time, Monday actually became Monday for me, and it was now a &#x201C;something&#x201D; in my life.<strong>Why did you start Every Monday Matters?<br></strong>Every Monday Matters, the company, started whether I wanted it to or not. Once the book came out, I guess it was &#x201C;game on, &#x201D; and people wanted more. So, it really started with the book.<strong>What problem are you trying to solve?<br></strong>I know it seems like we are trying to do a &#x201C;Monday Makeover,&#x201D; but it is obviously deeper than that. At the core of Every Monday Matters is a burning desire to help everyone understand that they matter. I think that every single person on the face of the earth has questioned his or her purpose. Why am I here? Why does it matter? Am I significant? This is life&#x2019;s greatest challenge, and our biggest question. People are powerful&#x2014;much more powerful than they think they are and their actions matter.A close friend once told me that it is just as powerful to be a person who focuses on making the world a better place as it is to be an asshole. So poignant and so true. Either way, what we say and do matter, and the ripple effects we create in the world matter. So, we have a choice. What do we want to ripple? Because whether or not we know it, we do. So, again, we have a choice to make, and why not have it happen every Monday?<strong>What&#x2019;s the bigger issue that sits above this?<br></strong>I am not sure if this is the bigger issue or part of the same issue, but there is also this idea of focus and self-perception. I didn&#x2019;t spend my life being an asshole, but I also didn&#x2019;t spend my life focused on making the world a better place. I just focused on ME. Things that brought fun to my life, things that I thought mattered, like fame and fortune, and all arrows pointed inward. But, it was the Saturday morning volunteering&#x2014;giving back&#x2014;that changed everything for me. It changed the direction of the arrows, and they now pointed outward. And in those moments, I realized that I am at my best when I am not making life about me, and when my life started to change, it started to make sense. I realized that I had significance and purpose in those moments. I realized that I could impact the world in a positive way, and in turn, I would feel more complete as a person. I guess that&#x2019;s the irony of it all. If you want to feel better about yourself and your life, stop focusing on yourself. It is so simple, but so hard for us to understand.<strong>Give me an example of the most transformational program you&#x2019;ve implemented.<br></strong>Last year, we launched our EMM Corporate Program. We believe that Employee Engagement and Corporate Social Responsibility are vital investments in a company&#x2019;s future for business success. It is about serving your employees and the people in your community that will ultimately result in serving your company. We also believe that great companies are built from the inside out. Our program is all about creating a culture where employees know how much they matter&#x2014;to one another, to the company, and to their community.One of our largest corporate clients has a goal of landing on Fortune Magazine&#x2019;s &#x201C;Top 100 Companies to Work For&#x201D; list. When we started working them, they had just completed the Morehead Employee Engagement Survey and received a score of 76%, meaning they were in the top quartile of companies surveyed when it comes to Employee Engagement. They just completed the survey process again (one year later) and received a score of 93%, meaning they are now in the top 10% of companies surveyed. That is a massive jump and success for them, and a great accomplishment toward reaching their goal.<strong>Give me an example of one life changed as a result.<br></strong>Between the book, our school curriculum, and our corporate program, the number and magnitude of the stories is beyond humbling. From homeless high school students who learned how much they matter and went on to graduate; to convicted felons who never had someone in their life that told them that they mattered; to a single mother that stopped a stranger from committing suicide; to the accumulative thousands of pounds that have been lost because people found a new sense of significance and pride in themselves; to a man that had 400 people at his mother&#x2019;s funeral each write a letter as to why his mother mattered them and then gave the 400 letters to his father; and to the wife that thanked us for now having a better husband. We don&#x2019;t even know all of the stories that are out there, but it is interesting how the tables turn. We are supposed to be the ones that inspire, but often feel like the ones being inspired.<strong>What&#x2019;s been the hardest part of starting Every Monday Matters?<br></strong>Patience. When you realize you have something that the world wants and needs, you just want it to get better, bigger, stronger, quicker. As we all know, starting a business takes time&#x2014;that&#x2019;s not revolutionary wisdom by any means. But, it doesn&#x2019;t mean it is easy to accept. I always have to be reminded that we are kicking butt and are right where we are supposed to be. That&#x2019;s where a bit of faith never hurts as well.<strong>What&#x2019;s been the most rewarding part of Every Monday Matters?<br></strong>Without a doubt, the stories&#x2014;they are what drive us to want to reach more people with our message.<strong>What advice would you give to anyone wanting to start a new business?<br></strong>For me it is all about passion. I have a passion that burns inside of me so bright that it has allowed me to get through things I never thought I could do. Even with all of my education, my MBA and my work experience, it seems like nothing really prepared me for the ride I have been on. The learning curve has been steep at every corner and it is only through my passion, and the passion of an amazing team of people, that has allowed us to do it. So, if you don&#x2019;t have passion for your idea, don&#x2019;t even start it&#x2014;just walk away.<strong>Where do you see Every Monday Matters in five years?<br></strong>I believe that five years from now, EMM will be a household name. We will have more books; we will be a massive social movement; we will have a radio show, a television show, an Internet show; we will become a program that cities adopt&#x2014;schools, companies, churches, governments, all working together to make their Mondays matter. I believe that Mondays will have officially changed forever.<strong>What do you love about Mondays?<br></strong>I get to come to work every Monday to try to make the world a better place, and that is truly a gift.&#xA0;<span class=\"blogdetail__text__ending\"></span><em>Photo: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/aftab/4153613907/in/photostream/\" target=\"_blank\">Aftab Uzzaman</a></em>"

       "content_body":"Written by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/garryridge/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Garry Ridge</a>Multiple leadership styles and philosophies may bring any CEO the desired results of market performance, both on Main and Wall Streets. But the options get fewer and fewer as the CEO puts <em>sustainable</em> performance on the agenda. Throw in the ideal of a cultural sense of ease, passion, commitment that would permeate all the stakeholders of the company&#x2019;s activities throughout time and throughout the world, and you have only one leadership style option that will work:The CEO must be completely dedicated to creating and sustaining a culture where all participants are free to focus, innovate, speak up, be themselves, make mistakes, be happy at work, and wholeheartedly align their personal purpose with the company&#x2019;s purpose. This is the requirement, even during those rare periods that demand a certain amount of personal sacrifice and faith in the leadership.How does this kind of commitment to a positive culture at a macro level over time bring sustainability to the CEO&#x2019;s expectations for the company&#x2019;s success year over year, decade over decade? This commitment to a cultural consistency creates a community of interdependent and mutually supportive people. At WD-40 Company we call this community our <em>tribe</em>. Tribe members bring to their jobs, careers, relationships and lives the following critical attributes:What emerges from this culture &#x2013; beyond the obviously desirable day-to-day experience of working with people we care about &#x2013; is that truly enviable performance history on every key metric that drives WD-40 Company&#x2019;s success story. Wherever I go, anywhere in the world, I am asked, &#x201C;How do you do that?&#x201D;To coin a phrase: The process is simple. But it&#x2019;s not easy. It requires commitment to high ideals at times when less-committed leaders might fold in pursuit of one more percentage point in profit, or when they must choose among an environmentally responsible ingredient, profit margin, or affordable price point for the consumer.The business literature is filled with many fine stories of efforts that CEOs make to recruit their employees in the mission of creating a business success story. From the long-term, sincere efforts to the short-term gimmicky attempts, there is no shortage of ideas you can try in your own company. But from what I have found over time is that nothing will hold up in any kind of meaningful way until four fundamentals are in place.I call them the <strong>Four Pillars of the Fearless Tribe.</strong> Imagine, for a moment, the sub-basement of a spectacular skyscraper. It&#x2019;s not so glamorous down there, to be sure. It&#x2019;s mostly bland concrete, specially formulated and poured to take on the weight of all that is above &#x2013; all those details and amenities selected to please, inspire, communicate, transform, enlighten, and ignite the imagination of all who interact with the building and its occupants.But you are unlikely to see any of that in the sub-basement. What you do see are massive, unadorned pillars. Considering the accumulated weight of all that they hold up, there are surprisingly few. In fact, the fewer the pillars, the better the engineering.Such is also the case for the Four Pillars of the Fearless Tribe. As we have engineered the WD-40 Company&#x2019;s cultural structure over time, we found that these four pillars hold up the entire experience of what it means to do business within the company. Each pillar is critical. They are:These are the essential structural supports, providing a distributed foundation under emotional weight that organizational psychologists refer to as psychological safety inside the workplace. In this document, I will first tell the story of WD-40 Company&#x2019;s success in metrics form. Then I will introduce to you the basic concepts of psychological safety as the academics are reporting on it today. And finally, I will describe our own four pillars, as we have identified them to be essential to holding up the culture that makes the WD-40 Company the joyful, successful tribe that it is today.<strong>What If All Your Employees Loved Coming to Work Every Day?</strong>To explore our tribal culture as the &#x201C;secret sauce&#x201D; of our successes, the first thing to do is define what we at WD-40 Company mean by the word &#x201C;tribe&#x201D;. Simon Sinek talks about a &#x201C;circle of safety,&#x201D; in which all the participants are collected and protected by a defining mutual agreement of values, practices, mission, purpose, and ways of doing things. There is an ongoing sense of belonging that is as consistent and dependable in the environment as the air we breathe. Once we are accepted into the group, we trust each other. We share knowledge freely and openly. We assume the best of each other&apos;s intentions at all times. We sacrifice for each other. We celebrate with each other. We honor our contributions as individuals without losing sight of the valuable, positive impact on the entire community. While no organization can achieve this state constantly or without being tested, our objective is to work toward achieving this condition at least 95% of the time.In his book, <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Tribe-Homecoming-Belonging-Sebastian-Junger-ebook/dp/B01BCJDSNI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1544553292&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=sebastian+junger%2C+tribe+of+homecoming+and+belonging\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tribe: On Homecoming and Belonging</a></em>, Sebastian Junger puts it this way: &#x201C;The earliest and most basic definition of community &#x2013; of tribe &#x2013; would be the group of people that you both help feed and help defend.&#x201D;Taking the effort to define and create a tribe in your company has obvious significant and unmistakable rewards. Dave Logan, John King, and Halee Fischer-Wright specify them beautifully in their book, <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Tribal-Leadership-Leveraging-Thriving-Organization-ebook/dp/B0012GTZFC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1544553342&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=tribal+leadership+book\">Tribal Leadership: Leveraging Natural Groups to Build a Thriving Organization</a></em>:How has our commitment to a tribal culture manifested itself in the experience of working at WD-40 Company and our market performance? That story is best told by the results of our 2018 Employee Engagement Index. Below are just some of the 26 queries that we have identified as key to our performance both in the marketplace globally and our own noble cause of making sure we are providing a workplace culture where our employees feel safe, supported, appreciated, inspired, innovative, curious, and optimistic. About 94% of global employees completed this survey, in seven languages:<em>&quot;I am clear on the company&apos;s goals&quot; 97.2%</em><em>&quot;I am excited about WD-40 Company&apos;s future direction.&quot; 93.4%</em><em>&quot;WD-40 Company encourages employees to continually imrpove in their job.&quot; 92.9%</em><em>&quot;I understand how my job contributes to acheiving WD-40 Company&apos;s goals.&quot; 97.9%</em><em>&quot;I know what results are expected of me.&quot; 97.4%</em><em>&quot;I feel my opinions and values are a good fit with the WD-40 Company culture.&quot; 98.1%</em>And, my personal favorite:<strong><em>&#x201C;I love to tell people that I work for WD-40 Company.&#x201D; 99.0%</em></strong>All these answers are experience-based. The way our tribe members experience their time at WD-40 Company shapes their perceptions of the company, and whether they feel it is a good place for them to invest their time, talents, and passion. Providing those experiences is, to all of us at WD-40 Company, a sacred responsibility for multiple reasons. We recognize that people spend the majority of their waking hours at work. So why shouldn&#x2019;t they feel fully fulfilled and supported by people they know, like, trust and respect? Don&#x2019;t we all deserve that daily expectation as part of our natural inheritance as humans in this world? And they bring those positive feelings home to their families at the end of the day. So we know that our tribe members&#x2019; positive feelings about the work they do contribute to the optimism that their family members carry with them into their own futures.How does this tribal engagement manifest in company performance? There is abundant literature showing the linkage between high engagement scores and company performance across companies and industries. So I&#x2019;ll just focus on what we&#x2019;re experiencing at WD-40 Company:Over the past 20 years that we have committed to these foundations, our sales have quadrupled. Our market cap has increased from $250 million to nearly $2.5 billion. And during these last two decades, our annual compounded growth rate of total shareholder return is 15%.The proof of the pudding, as they say, is in the eating. Those numbers represent a whole lot of product. But our second most important value is, &#x201C;We create positive lasting memories in all of our relationships.&#x201D; Engagement, and thus personal investment in the organization, stems from positive experiences within the tribe, which yields the applause of financial performance.<strong>Psychological Safety &#x2013; A Brief Introduction<br></strong>In this dynamic environment, successful organizations need to be managed as complex adaptive systems rather than as intricate controlled machines. -Amy C. Edmondson, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Teaming-Organizations-Innovate-Compete-Knowledge-ebook/dp/B007MF3BRA/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1544553772&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=amy+edmondson+books\"><em>Teaming: How Organizations Learn, Innovate, and Compete in the Knowledge Economy</em></a><br><br>It&#x2019;s been almost a century since productivity experts turned their focus on how companies can optimize production by improving the human aspect of the organizational systems. In the earliest decades, their attention was on how humans and machines could interact better, incremental improvement by incremental improvement &#x2013; with humans standing in the service of the machines. Then, predictably, as the Knowledge Economy took predominance over the manufacturing sector, the focus was turned to how individual employees could perform better as separate functional entities &#x2013; their workstations being primarily between their ears &#x2013; generating each company&#x2019;s competitive edge through innovative, original thinking.Consequently, over time, organizational psychologists and corporate leaders are coming to fully realize the critical role that mental health plays in a company&#x2019;s performance. As the Knowledge Economy evolves, we leaders are beginning to acknowledge &#x2013; even, for some of us, embrace &#x2013; our roles in creating a cultural experience where our people are free to contribute their best because they feel safe. As Maslow&apos;s Hierarchy of Needs has proven, without a sense of safety (survival, family preservation), it&apos;s impossible to think long term and to stay engaged. After those basic, hygienic needs are met, people then need to feel that they belong to a welcoming, non-judging tribe, where they can count on the support of others. Then they can focus on their performance, secure in the knowledge that their community of colleagues &#x2013; their tribe &#x2013; wish them the very best. And the feeling is reciprocal.This is called psychological safety, an expression first introduced by the organizational culture pioneer Edgar Schein. Amy Edmondson, the Novartis Professor of Leadership at Harvard Business School, has subsequently developed this concept to encompass the entire team experience. Edmondson&#x2019;s research encourages a shift in focus from production (which she calls &#x201C;organizing to execute&#x201D;) to a &#x201C;new way of working that supports collaboration, innovation, and organizational learning.&#x201D;&#x201C;Learning in today&#x2019;s organizations involves what&#x2019;s called <em>reciprocal interdependence</em>, where back-and-forth communications are essential to getting the work done,&#x201D; Edmondson writes in Teaming, outlining workplace conditions where a psychologically safe culture is essential:What culture in today&#x2019;s global business environment does <em>not</em> have any of the elements that require team members to work together freely, generously, and fearlessly? And yet, there are so many opportunities inside every business, within every business day, where the best of intentions, the best of ideas can go to smash because of a misunderstanding or betrayed trust.Edmondson adds, &#x201C;The knowledge-based economy only works well when it restores workers on all levels to self-respecting, self-determining adulthood.&#x201D;For this to be effective, they need to feel safe &#x2013; not only physically safe but emotionally secure to focus on their work and bring new ideas to the table without fear of retribution. Just as we at WD-40 Company celebrate what we call <em>the learning moment,</em> Edmondson calls leaders&#x2019; attention to the need for companies to emphasize their value on learning without reprisal as a key component to the psychologically safe culture.&#x201C;This calls for workers who know how to experiment, how to think on their feet, how to work in the absence of rules, and how to adapt quickly,&#x201D; she writes. &#x201C;Knowledge, changing quickly within disciplines, becomes even messier and more uncertain when integrated across disciplines&#x2026;to get things done in the new workplace. Creating an appropriate environment for teaming and learning requires different management skills and expectations from those required in a repetitive task environment&#x2026;today&#x2019;s managers need employees to be problem solvers and experimenters, not mere conformers.&#x201D;To cultivate a culture of these confident, independent, interdependent team members, leaders are increasingly recognizing the need for their entire community of talent to be integrated by the same sets of values and expectations. When those are in place, they are free to focus, create, and bring your company to the fore in its competitiveness and ability to attract and retain the very best talent to continue the march toward the future.At WD-40 Company, this culture starts with those Four Pillars of the Fearless Tribe.<strong>The Four Pillars Explained</strong><br>&quot;Knowledge is only rumor until it lives in the bones.&quot;<br>Asaro tribe in Papua New Guinea, as quoted by Brene Brown, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dare-Lead-Brave-Conversations-Hearts-ebook/dp/B07CWGFPS7/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1544554176&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=dare+to+lead+brene+brown\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dare to Lead</a>The success stories of other companies are especially interesting when they carry indicators of how we can transform their examples into actionable insights to apply to our own organizations. It&#x2019;s one thing to know the success metrics of highly admired companies such as WD-40, but the real value is understanding the ways you can duplicate WD-40 Company&#x2019;s approach to the extent that&#x2019;s appropriate to your business.Your culture is different, as it should be. So copying WD-40 Company&#x2019;s example in all its details &#x2013; as you might a cookbook recipe &#x2013; could set you up for failure. However, the foundational pillars that I introduced above are duplicable anywhere. No matter your industry, business, market, demographics, geographic location, these four pillars will support your own culture where your people will be proud to go to work every day. Install these four pillars, and you will have the foundational support you need to create the business that all your stakeholders will be proud to be associated with.<strong>Care</strong>&quot;Life is short. Do whatever you can to help people - not for status, but because the 95-year-old you will be proud if you did help people and disappointed if you didn&apos;t.&quot; -Marshall GoldsmithImagine the company environment where you and your people go to work every day, as a tribe you make a contribution for something bigger than yourself, you learn something new, you feel safe, and you go home happy. That&#x2019;s what a <em>caring organization is</em>.As I&#x2019;ve witnessed the concept of Care come alive at WD-40 Company, I see our commitment to creating that caring organization flip all the levers that make life inside a healthy community a good, rewarding, fulfilling place to be. The caring culture is an environment where people are given the latitude to apply the principles of basic human kindness, gratitude for all that we have, the pursuit of justice, trust, transparency in our relationships throughout the organization, and the safe experience of honest conversation (which we will explore further in the next pillar &#x2013; which is Candor).Let&#x2019;s first explore what the <em>caring organization</em> is not: It&#x2019;s not Friday night gatherings where we all sing <em>Kumbaya</em>. It&#x2019;s not about making decisions that have the least amount of negative impact on individual self-interests in the short-term. The caring organization is not a hug, a flower, or a brownie to soothe hurt feelings. The caring organization is not about creating a narrative where the CEO feels good about having the reputation for being a caring leader, at the expense of longer-term objectives.There will be tough decisions. The caring organization strikes a balance between being tough-minded and tenderhearted. It&#x2019;s unconditional love &#x2013; to the extent appropriate in a business setting &#x2013; combined with the commitment to doing what you need to do to keep people safe. The caring organization creates the environment that expects you to do what you must to execute on a rigorous business plan so that it endures over time. Caring also means that every tribe member has a responsibility to care about everybody else.When I consider the fundamental elements of the caring organization, along with its most basic promise, the word trust comes to mind. It is the ultimate value proposition of the caring organization. To break this concept down in actionable components, we draw from Cynthia Olmstead&#x2019;s Trust Model, as described in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Trust-Works-Building-Lasting-Relationships-ebook/dp/B009NR02QS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1544554397&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=trust+works+by+ken+blanchard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trust Works!</a>, the book she wrote with Ken Blanchard and Martha Lawrence. It follows the simple ABCD format:A &#x2013; Are you <em>able</em>? Are you competent?B &#x2013; Are you <em>believable</em>? Do your actions reflect your words?C &#x2013; Are you <em>connected</em>? Do you take time to be with people in a meaningful, emotionally authentic way?D &#x2013; Are you <em>dependable</em>? Do you do what you say you&#x2019;re going to do? Can people rely on you?Trust is the fundamental experience of the caring community. When you have trust, you have a tribe who will trust that you have their best interests always at heart. They will follow you into high-risk, long-term territory where great business outcomes will be found.<strong>Candor</strong><br>&quot;The void created by the failure to communicate is soon filled with poison, drivel, and misrepresentation.&quot; -C. Northcote ParkinsonThe second element in Olmstead&#x2019;s Trust Model is B for <em>believable</em>. A culture where everyone is believable (not just the leaders) is one where everyone feels safe to speak their truth as they know it. This doesn&#x2019;t automatically presume that everyone will agree with each version of the stated truth. But without a culture of safety where everyone can be counted on to express themselves, the entire community will forfeit the enriching benefit of all points of view.And, as Parkinson famously noted, the result of restrained truth is a toxic stew of half-truths, misunderstandings, critical decisions made based on only partial information, fractured relationships, stifled passions, and, before long, the regrettable departure of your most cherished talent.This pillar of Candor shows up in actual behaviors: No lying, no faking, no hiding. Period. How this shows up to the leaders: They must always be prepared to be open and receptive to unpleasant information. How this shows up to the tribe as a whole: Each tribe member feels safe to take the risk of speaking the truth. In fact, when this pillar is installed correctly, on a cultural level, each tribe member feels more at risk for <em>not</em> speaking up.The safety is in the communication. This is the open avenue to delivering the best self that every tribe member has. Truth, told respectfully and with positive intent, creates safety.Most people don&#x2019;t consider themselves to be liars. But it&#x2019;s safe to say that many people will fake and/or hide when they feel they must protect their best self-interests. They fear reprisal.Faking is simply not being true to yourself and your values. We&#x2019;ve all heard, &#x201C;Fake it until you make it.&#x201D; People think, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m just going to fake this because I&#x2019;m afraid that people will see that I don&#x2019;t know something everyone else seems to know [for the record, they could be faking as well].&#x201D; Or, &#x201C;People will think less of me when they realize that I&#x2019;m the only one in the room who has a completely different perspective on this matter.&#x201D;Hiding occurs when there is something they don&#x2019;t disclose because there is fear of failure; fear of some sort of negative reaction, either from the tribe or tribe leaders; or fear of being caught in having done the wrong thing &#x2013; or the right thing wrong.In the psychologically safe workplace, we all hold dear the principle that when we behave in good faith and with good intentions, there is nothing we could do that would cause us to hide. And the spirit of the learning moment, which is such a crucial component of the psychologically safe workplace, is being true to ourselves and sharing our error with our tribe members. When we are, we are bringing additional wisdom and knowledge to the group as a whole. If we hide our mistakes, we deprive our entire team of essential learning.As we have discussed above, the essential value of the psychologically safe workplace is the promotion of flow by the absence of friction. A workplace culture devoid of trust is an experience filled with friction. Candor removes that lack of clarity, deletes the confusion, smooths the surfaces of engagement of the rough splintery texture of emotional sticking points. And candor sets the stage for clear exchange of ideas. This is the value that promotes a high-performing workplace culture.This isn&#x2019;t to say that candor-based conversations are easy. Some can be tough to initiate, some even tougher to be on the receiving end. Candor is not permission to be brutal, in the name of being honest. Candor must be accompanied by caring. All tribe members &#x2013; especially leaders &#x2013; should take extra care to fill the emotional bank accounts of their colleagues with positivity and supportive relationship interactions. This way, when the time comes for a conversation that requires uncomfortable candor, the trust is already there. Even the toughest conversation will result in strengthened trust that will prevail over the momentary discomfort of disclosure and discussion.(For additional insight on this topic, read my blog post, <a href=\"https://thelearningmoment.net/when-caring-collides-with-candor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">When Caring Collides With Candor.</a>)<strong>Accountability</strong>&quot;Accountability is hard. Blame is easy. One builds trust. The other destroys it.&quot; -Simon SinekIt seems that in these modern times, <em>accountability</em> is seen as a negative thing &#x2013; an occasion to punish someone should that person fall short of the agreed upon standard or goal. That person is on the hot seat, and now must <em>account</em> for their disappointing performance.At WD-40 Company, we have a different relationship with the word <em>accountability</em>. We see it as a two-way street in which leaders and their direct reports equally hold ownership of the way we perform our duties and what outcomes our efforts lead to. For this reason, for example, we tell our leaders that their job is to make sure their direct reports have everything they need to succeed in their jobs (for more information, read my blog post, <a href=\"https://thelearningmoment.net/dont-mark-my-paper-help-me-get-an-a/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&apos;t Mark My Paper, Help Me Get an A</a>). And all our tribe members hold ownership of making sure they have what they need to succeed and lead the company to its fulfilled objectives.Accountability, as a pillar, is a mutual discipline. But it&#x2019;s not the occasion to be disciplined. The disciplined commitment to results itself is, in practice, a freedom of sorts. When the company is committed to promoting accountability in its tribe, the individuals who demonstrate accountability also hold permission to do whatever is necessary to meet that accountability.WD-40 Company&#x2019;s Maniac Pledge is an example of this philosophy in action. Years ago, a direct report spent a great deal of time explaining to me why a goal was not accomplished within the agreed-upon time. The blame was placed on a lack of critical information required to take the necessary action. After hearing the tribe member out, I observed the simple truth out loud, &#x201C;In the same amount of time it took you to explain to me why this commitment didn&#x2019;t happen, you could have acquired the information you needed to get the job done.&#x201D;And at that moment the Maniac Pledge was born, named after Aussie golfer Greg Norman, who was known for his maniac spirit. It reads this way:I am responsible for taking action, asking questions, getting answers, and making decisions. I won&#x2019;t wait for someone to tell me. If I need to know, I&#x2019;m responsible for asking. I have no right to be offended that I didn&#x2019;t &#x201C;get this sooner.&#x201D; If I&#x2019;m doing something others should know about, I&#x2019;m responsible for telling them.This spells freedom &#x2013; the freedom that our tribe members feel is necessary to get their job done and meet their obligations to their own direct reports, as well as to their direct supervisors. In our tribe, we don&apos;t have the victim&apos;s attitude; there are many reasons and no excuses. We face the facts, learn and move to improve.To us at WD-40 Company, accountability is manifested by the commitment that each tribe member holds in carrying through with their commitments. It is an understanding and expectation culturally that each one of us will own the desired outcome and all the steps required to achieve that outcome. For both ourselves and for the people throughout the organization chart who depend on us to help them be successful as well.Accountability is achievement. But it&#x2019;s also learning that we are responsible for sharing with the rest of the tribe. And the community celebration when that outcome is realized.It&#x2019;s fashionable to talk about &#x201C;accountability partners&#x201D; today. These are people we meet at the gym, on volunteer teams or in work groups who we must rely upon on regularly for mutual support in accomplishing our goals. But, really, our first accountability partner is the face in the mirror. Are we, as individuals, at peace with our actions and choices? If we have a face-to-face conversation (with our own faces) about how well we honor integrity to ourselves, how will we hold up in the investigation? As we say at WD-40 Company, when things go right, look out the window to find all the other people who contributed. When something goes awry, look in the mirror first.We are each our own supervisors. And we are each our own direct reports. Are we giving ourselves what we need to make sure we succeed and that we help our company succeed?<strong>Responsibility</strong>&quot;Too many leaders act as if the sheep &#x2026; their people &#x2026; are there for the benefit of the shepherd, not that the shepherd has responsibility for the sheep.&quot; -Ken BlanchardLet&#x2019;s revisit the Maniac Pledge one more time. You probably have noticed that each item of the Pledge is driven by the words, &#x201C;I am responsible for&#x2026;.&#x201D; <em>Responsible</em> appears three times in the Maniac Pledge. In Accountability we speak of the outcome. In Responsibility, we speak of the <em>relationship</em> each tribe member has to the ideal that generates the outcome.Simply put, Responsibility is a turbo-charged version of Accountability. As a tribe, now that we know what we&#x2019;re accountable for, it&#x2019;s our responsibility to make sure those desirable outcomes are actually realized. We each take personal ownership of the outcomes, and it&#x2019;s up to each of us to do whatever it takes to make it happen. Consequences (rewards and negative feedback in its variety of forms) are attached to the Responsibility pillar.Responsibility is each tribe member&#x2019;s personal relationship to their role in realizing the ideal outcome. It demands that each tribe member respond with the answer &#x201C;me,&#x201D; when the world poses the question, &#x201C;Who is there to act?&#x201D;When it comes to psychological safety inside the workplace, when each tribe member is confident that everyone else shares responsibility in the company&#x2019;s success, the entire community feels safe to invest their hearts, minds, talents, efforts, risks in realizing the company vision that everyone agreed to. Everyone has their part and role. And everyone performs exactly as expected, because everyone shares the responsibility of a successful outcome.I&#x2019;m reminded of a strategy in rugby called the <em>blind pass</em>. In American football, even non-fans know how marvelous it is to watch as a quarterback throws a long pass into seemingly empty air &#x2013; but with every expectation that a team member is on his way and will be positioned in the right place to receive the ball when it ends its flight and drops into his hands. You don&#x2019;t have to be an expert football fan to be impressed by the skill, strength, accuracy and teamwork of that play.Well, in Australian rugby, that pass is basically performed backward &#x2013; hence the name <em>blind pass</em>. The quarterback is running, but throws the ball backward, without being able to see whether there is going to be a team member likely to receive the ball. That is responsibility in action because the quarterback is psychologically safe in trusting that the pass will be completed and the objective of the play will be accomplished. There will be no wasted time, motion, effort, faith, trust, or ambition because everyone holds the assumption that the ideal of responsibility is equally shared amongst them all.<strong>Now You Have a Foundation</strong><br><br>These four pillars are your foundation, upon which you can build strong and enduringly positive relationships among people who rely on your leadership. If you are the CEO, you have the highest likelihood of being able to spread this cultural foundation throughout the organization.
